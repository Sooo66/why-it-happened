While it is plausible that the Senate’s planned vote is a reaction to Trump’s tariff announcements, the contexts do not explicitly or implicitly link Event 1 (the tariff announcement) as the direct cause of Event 2 (the Senate's planned vote); the Senate could be responding to the overall tariff policy, not just this specific announcement.
