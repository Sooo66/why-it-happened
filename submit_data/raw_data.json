        "content": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, just like many other public health emergencies, is a well-established global health burden that has resulted in several changes in routines and lifestyles of people globally. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has directly or indirectly involved in the loss of lives of more than 3.24 million as of 6th May, 2021. The increasing threats posed by this pandemic were subsided by the swift and drastic measures put in place by different countries. As other causes of death before the emergence of COVID-19 still exist, the pandemic has further worsened their impact. The increased risks of COVID-19 deaths are not only due to the health burden it possesses, but also due to some other factors. These factors include domestic violence that becomes rampant, especially during lockdowns; hunger due to low economic development, unemployment, and loss of jobs; suicide due to depression; exhausted health system due to high level of COVID-19 cases and inability to contain it. As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic’s direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery. This paper identifies other causes of death amidst the pandemic, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, and how to minimize their effects.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest respiratory disease outbreaks affecting several countries simultaneously and has affected over 200 countries as of April 2021 (David and Ozuluoha, 2020). As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic’s direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery (Bernard et al., 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has affected many homes and families. It has caused numerous deaths in the world with greater collateral damages in some low and middle-income countries where people do not have access to proper healthcare, food, and jobs (Lim et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These factors have, in turn, influenced other triggers of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The numerous deaths triggered by COVID-19 and other factors that made the pandemic out of control, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, are discussed extensively in this paper, and suitable solutions that could reduce these risks are proposed in detail.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Human Lives\n\nWhile different countries’ policies vary, a lockdown declaration seemed like a common occurrence across many countries (De Ver Dye et al., 2020). The declared lockdown, though having many advantages, came in with other notable disadvantages. Some of the considerable impacts are seen on the health of people with chronic diseases (Umaru et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2020a), treatment of malaria (Aborode et al., 2021a), education (Lawal et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2020b), drugs supply (Dada et al., 2020), healthcare services (David and Adebisi, 2020; Ahmad et al., 2021). The magnitude of these impacts has created an atmosphere where people are more susceptible to deaths not only directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic, but indirectly to other factors.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nCOVID-19 has radically changed the lives of many individuals. During the quarantine mandated by governments to curb the spread of COVID-19, domestic violence made some people’s homes a more dangerous place to live and survive. This could be because they must stay the whole day with partners and away from people who can witness their experiences and give help. Many abusive situations were on an increase due to economic crises linked to COVID-19 emergence (many victims have difficulty leaving abusive partners for financial reasons). In addition, lockdown triggered the increased risk of domestic violence where parents fight with one another, children unable to handle the mental stress of such acts, thus increasing the prevalence of suicide, mental instability, and physical deformation (Elbert et al., 2018; Cluver et al., 2020). A recent study has proven a rise in domestic violence and social decadences during pandemics (Brooks et al., 2020). The rise in domestic violence during pandemics increases the level of violence and social menace that cannot be control easily due to low engagement of people and lockdown. Domestic violence during pandemics is linked to the adoption of negative stress coping mechanisms that occur between spouses, parents, and individuals during pandemic lockdowns. Lockdown also brings abusers closer to their victims for an extended period, consequently increasing the probabilities of repeated occurrences (Brenner, 1987; Reynolds et al., 2008; Palermo and Peterman, 2011).\n\nSeveral media reports indicate a surge in domestic violence cases in various countries (Lima et al., 2020; van Gelder et al., 2020; Gearin and Knight, 2020). According to Kagi (2020), the overall crime rates in Australia have declined, however, the rate of domestic abuse increased by 5%. Some charities in Australia also raised concerns about COVID-19 misinformation used by the offenders to further control and abuse domestic violence victims (Kagi, 2020). Allen-Ebrahimian (2020) reported that China witnessed a threefold increase in domestic violence cases after imposing lockdown. Different states in the United States also reported about 21–35% increase in the number of domestic violence recorded (Wagers, 2020). According to Bradbury-Jones and Isham (2020), the lockdown imposed to deal with COVID-19 pandemic has granted greater freedom to abusers. It has become easier for the abusers to enforce control tactics by limiting the victims’ access to phones, the internet, and other people, while van Gelder et al. (2020) also emphasized that the lockdown limits familiar support options.\n\nThe proposed solutions to the occurrences of domestic violence are strengthening online support and aids systems (Haneef and Kalyanpur, 2020). There should be advocacy platforms aimed at curtailing the several factors catalyzing the spikes in violence against persons (WHO, 2020). Also, there should be proposed plans that will reduce the risk triggers of domestic violence, which results to death during COVID-19 pandemic. It is required that prioritizing violence prevention within the global public health agenda be encouraged. This can be done by defining the problem through the systematic collection of information, using research evidence to determine the causes and risk factors of violence, and implement effective interventions to prevent violence. Achieving these goals becomes particularly important during the pandemic because violence against women has dramatically increased (WHO, 2020). The effectiveness of online safety and health interventions for different needs of women who have experienced intimate partner violence have already been outlined previously (El-Serag and Thurston, 2020; Ford-Gilboe et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, to reduce the mortality rates due to domestic violence during COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for funding sources to enhance telephone or remote counseling services with high-speed internet, hotlines, and emergence shelters. It is also mandatory to identify high-risk individuals and admonish them to avoid extreme events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide.\n\nHunger\n\nAgriculture has remained the primary source of food globally, and hence agriculture plays a vital role in the nation’s economic development. The lockdowns imposed by countries have resulted in an obstruction to the free flow of all the stages involved in agriculture i.e. from farm to fork (including production, processing, distribution, and consumption). This has consequently resulted in a hike in the prices of food commodities (Torero, 2020). As a result of this increase in food prices and a further anticipated hike, food shortages, malnutrition, and even deaths have been recorded (Torero, 2020). The United Nations World Food Program has estimated that by the end of the year 2020, over 265 million people could suffer from food shortages and hunger (Food Security Information Network, 2020).\n\nIn a national survey conducted in the United States of America, it was shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has directly increased the rate of food insecurity in households having children (Bauer, 2020). This survey showed that 34.5% of households with a child ≤18 years old and 34.4% of families with children ≤12 years old were experiencing food shortages by the end of April 2020, compared with 14.7 and 15.1% in 2018, respectively (Bauer, 2020). It was also shown that 17.4% of mothers with children ≤12 years old reported that “the children in my household were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food,” compared to 3.1% in 2018 (Bauer, 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic aggravated the hunger crisis in the world’s hunger hotspots and created new epicenters of hunger worldwide. By the end of the year, 12,000 people per day died from COVID-19 pandemic, which is linked to hunger, potentially more than the disease (Siguerva et al., 2020). The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality, and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the socioeconomic disparities across borders and communities, there has been expansive togetherness, love, and care. The lockdown, however, introduced several economic hardships Siguerva et al. (2020); Aborode et al. (2021b), such as coronavirus famine, food insecurity and adverse hunger, which triggered risk of human death. Neglecting to combat hunger may have caused severe malnutrition and starvation, as evident in war-torn or ravaged ambient. These correlated to salient risk factors or determinants Chukwuma (2020) for compromised immune systems and facilitated susceptibility to infection rates, life-threatening disorders associated with the novel coronavirus. These disorders include severe respiratory distress, pneumonia, diarrhea, cholera, other gastrointestinal diseases Chaolin et al. (2020), and emerging and re-emerging diseases Chukwuma (2018) to poor sanitation and inadequate water supply.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of hunger during COVID-19 pandemic on human lives, there is a need for COVID-19 economic recovery palliative. This will provide families with prompt and adequate access to food and other resources during and after the pandemic crisis. There is also a need for an improvement in the nutritional intake of people who are vulnerable- mostly people with low standard of living and other factors that trigger their vulnerability such as health issues (El Zowalaty et al., 2020). Sustainable development policies, actions, and good governance will reduce and eventually eradicate the burden of poverty triggered by hunger (Chukwuma, 2020; Abdullahi et al., 2021). Sustainable steps need to be taken to prevent deaths secondary to hunger amidst the pandemic, as they can affect other sectors if not duly attended to because human survival depends on quality foods. In addition, there should be an assurance that food will be readily available to people who need them. This is to mitigate the consequences posed by hunger, which can result in death if there is no action implemented.\n\nSuicide\n\nThe potential of COVID-19 pandemic to cause long-lasting morbidity implies that it may serve as a risk factor for mental illness and suicide in the end. It was found that psychosis (a risk factor for suicide) was high in people during the H1N1, MERS, and SARS pandemics (Rogers et al., 2020). Wasserman (1992) stated that the Spanish flu epidemic (1918–1920) resulted in a slight increase in the number of suicide cases in the United States of America. In Hong Kong, the 2003 SARS epidemic also increased the rates of suicide cases (Cheung et al., 2008). Generally, few studies have investigated the impact of prior pandemics on suicide rates (Wasserman, 1992; Cheung et al., 2008).\n\nThe factors that result in suicide during COVID-19 are also due to the economic hardship faced by people, with loss of jobs occupying the premium position. Other factors that trigger suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic are entrapment, social isolation, alcohol consumption, and loneliness (O’Connor and Kirtley, 2018; David et al., 2020b).\n\nTo reduce the rate of suicide triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, there should be programs and awareness campaigns organized by NGOs and government bodies that will ensure proper mental health education for people. These programs would inform them on how to take care of their mental health and why they need to take care of their loved ones. The lockdowns imposed in several parts of the world have resulted in economic hardship and loss of jobs for many people, thus creating financial stressors (Cheung et al., 2008). These are among the risk factors for suicide. The government should provide financial security to ease the hardship posed by these circumstances. These can be in the form of housing, food, employment support, and consideration for their future and not just their current situations. There should be a responsible reporting of suicide cases so that people can maintain their emotional and mental stability; irresponsible reporting of spikes of suicide recorded instilled fear in people’s minds (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020). Finally, support in form of easy-accessible and well-distributed telephone help-lines should be available to help people with their mental health.\n\nDeaths Triggered by Exhausted Health System\n\nThe disruption of healthcare services to other medical conditions due to the drifted attention given to COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many deaths (Santoli et al., 2020). The deaths triggered by healthcare inability to provide services to all patients was because of the priorities given to COVID-19 patients and suspected patients at the expense of others (Lange et al., 2020). During the pandemic, regular healthcare services inevitably reduced because of concerns about SARS-CoV-2 exposure, restructuring regular hospital facilities to facilitate the COVID-19 patients, shifting of health professionals from their professional department to COVID-19 departments, shortage of beds, shortage of operation theaters, and shortage of doctors and nurses (Babatunde et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2021c). This has also decreased in-person services, and supported the use telehealth in order to address some healthcare needs of patients (Lange et al., 2020).\n\nTo solve the problem of increased deaths from other causes due to healthcare system’s inability to provide services to all patients, balancing the direct response to COVID-19 with the need for other health services’ continuous delivery is a universal dilemma for policymakers (Aborode et al., 2021d). It is particularly challenging for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems already face enormous demands to address infectious and non-communicable diseases coupled with significant resource constraints (Oseran et al., 2020; Abdullahi et al., 2020). The leaders should evaluate different policy options that will effectively respond to COVID-19 by exacerbating all the causes of morbidity and mortality among the population from neglecting or diverting care for other conditions (Stuckler et al., 2009).\n\nFurthermore, exploring underlying reasons for medical care avoidance should be act on, which include people with disabilities, people with underlying health conditions, unpaid caregivers for adults, and those who face structural inequities. If care for population survival rate and standard of living were neglected because of concerns about SARS-CoV-2 exposure or if there were closures or limited options for in-person services, providing accessible telehealth or in-home health care could address some of these issues (Oseran et al., 2020).\n\nCommunities, health care systems, and public health agencies should foster equity by working together to ensure access to information, testing, and care to all. The higher prevalence of medical care delay or avoidance among patients with high medical service bills or payments on people with no money might reflect differences in medical care-seeking behaviors (Chan et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many unprecedented events and an increase in the number of non-COVID-19 deaths. To deal with the direct effects of the pandemic and prior to universally available vaccination, many governments have imposed lockdowns to reduce the viral spread. This, however, has resulted, in social distancing, economic instability, mental health problems, isolation, depression, domestic violence, suicide, hunger, and a strained healthcare system that was not able to provide services as usual (David et al., 2020a). Although there have been studies exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the causes of death triggered by other factors such as domestic violence, suicide, hunger, and exhausted healthcare system is of great importance. There is a need for NGOs, governments, and individuals to play a role in mitigating these challenges.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThere is no data available for this study as this is a perspective research study..\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nKD, IY, and AA conceptualized the topic.

The coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , caused by SARS-CoV-2 , has directly or indirectly involved in the loss of lives of more than 3.24 million as of 6th May , 2021 . The increasing threats posed by this pandemic were subsided by the swift and drastic measures put in place by different countries . As other causes of death before the emergence of COVID-19 still exist , the pandemic has further worsened their impact . The increased risks of COVID-19 deaths are not only due to the health burden it possesses , but also due to some other factors . These factors include domestic violence that becomes rampant , especially during lockdowns ; hunger due to low economic development , unemployment , and loss of jobs ; suicide due to depression ; exhausted health system due to high level of COVID-19 cases and inability to contain it . As we move from the response phase into recovery , the pandemic ’ s direct and broader impacts on individuals , households , and communities will influence the capacity to recover . An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery . This paper identifies other causes of death amidst the pandemic , such as domestic violence , hunger , suicide , and exhausted health system , and how to minimize their effects . Introduction The current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest respiratory disease outbreaks affecting several countries simultaneously and has affected over 200 countries as of April 2021 ( David and Ozuluoha , 2020 ) . As we move from the response phase into recovery , the pandemic ’ s direct and broader impacts on individuals , households , and communities will influence the capacity to recover . An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery ( Bernard et al. , 2020 ) . COVID-19 pandemic has affected many homes and families . It has caused numerous deaths in the world with greater collateral damages in some low and middle-income countries where people do not have access to proper healthcare , food , and jobs ( Lim et al. , 2020 ; Wang et al. , 2020 ) . These factors have , in turn , influenced other triggers of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic . The numerous deaths triggered by COVID-19 and other factors that made the pandemic out of control , such as domestic violence , hunger , suicide , and exhausted health system , are discussed extensively in this paper , and suitable solutions that could reduce these risks are proposed in detail . Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Human Lives While different countries ’ policies vary , a lockdown declaration seemed like a common occurrence across many countries ( De Ver Dye et al. , 2020 ) . The declared lockdown , though having many advantages , came in with other notable disadvantages . Some of the considerable impacts are seen on the health of people with chronic diseases ( Umaru et al. , 2020 ; Aborode et al. , 2020a ) , treatment of malaria ( Aborode et al. , 2021a ) , education ( Lawal et al. , 2020 ; Aborode et al. , 2020b ) , drugs supply ( Dada et al. , 2020 ) , healthcare services ( David and Adebisi , 2020 ; Ahmad et al. , 2021 ) . The magnitude of these impacts has created an atmosphere where people are more susceptible to deaths not only directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic , but indirectly to other factors . Domestic Violence COVID-19 has radically changed the lives of many individuals . During the quarantine mandated by governments to curb the spread of COVID-19 , domestic violence made some people ’ s homes a more dangerous place to live and survive . This could be because they must stay the whole day with partners and away from people who can witness their experiences and give help . Many abusive situations were on an increase due to economic crises linked to COVID-19 emergence ( many victims have difficulty leaving abusive partners for financial reasons ) . In addition , lockdown triggered the increased risk of domestic violence where parents fight with one another , children unable to handle the mental stress of such acts , thus increasing the prevalence of suicide , mental instability , and physical deformation ( Elbert et al. , 2018 ; Cluver et al. , 2020 ) . A recent study has proven a rise in domestic violence and social decadences during pandemics ( Brooks et al. , 2020 ) . The rise in domestic violence during pandemics increases the level of violence and social menace that can not be control easily due to low engagement of people and lockdown . Domestic violence during pandemics is linked to the adoption of negative stress coping mechanisms that occur between spouses , parents , and individuals during pandemic lockdowns . Lockdown also brings abusers closer to their victims for an extended period , consequently increasing the probabilities of repeated occurrences ( Brenner , 1987 ; Reynolds et al. , 2008 ; Palermo and Peterman , 2011 ) . Several media reports indicate a surge in domestic violence cases in various countries ( Lima et al. , 2020 ; van Gelder et al. , 2020 ; Gearin and Knight , 2020 ) . According to Kagi ( 2020 ) , the overall crime rates in Australia have declined , however , the rate of domestic abuse increased by 5 % . Some charities in Australia also raised concerns about COVID-19 misinformation used by the offenders to further control and abuse domestic violence victims ( Kagi , 2020 ) . Allen-Ebrahimian ( 2020 ) reported that China witnessed a threefold increase in domestic violence cases after imposing lockdown . Different states in the United States also reported about 21–35 % increase in the number of domestic violence recorded ( Wagers , 2020 ) . According to Bradbury-Jones and Isham ( 2020 ) , the lockdown imposed to deal with COVID-19 pandemic has granted greater freedom to abusers . It has become easier for the abusers to enforce control tactics by limiting the victims ’ access to phones , the internet , and other people , while van Gelder et al . ( 2020 ) also emphasized that the lockdown limits familiar support options . The proposed solutions to the occurrences of domestic violence are strengthening online support and aids systems ( Haneef and Kalyanpur , 2020 ) . There should be advocacy platforms aimed at curtailing the several factors catalyzing the spikes in violence against persons ( WHO , 2020 ) . Also , there should be proposed plans that will reduce the risk triggers of domestic violence , which results to death during COVID-19 pandemic . It is required that prioritizing violence prevention within the global public health agenda be encouraged . This can be done by defining the problem through the systematic collection of information , using research evidence to determine the causes and risk factors of violence , and implement effective interventions to prevent violence . Achieving these goals becomes particularly important during the pandemic because violence against women has dramatically increased ( WHO , 2020 ) . The effectiveness of online safety and health interventions for different needs of women who have experienced intimate partner violence have already been outlined previously ( El-Serag and Thurston , 2020 ; Ford-Gilboe et al. , 2020 ) . Moreover , to reduce the mortality rates due to domestic violence during COVID-19 pandemic , there is a need for funding sources to enhance telephone or remote counseling services with high-speed internet , hotlines , and emergence shelters . It is also mandatory to identify high-risk individuals and admonish them to avoid extreme events such as impulsive acts , homicide , or suicide . Hunger Agriculture has remained the primary source of food globally , and hence agriculture plays a vital role in the nation ’ s economic development . The lockdowns imposed by countries have resulted in an obstruction to the free flow of all the stages involved in agriculture i.e . from farm to fork ( including production , processing , distribution , and consumption ) . This has consequently resulted in a hike in the prices of food commodities ( Torero , 2020 ) . As a result of this increase in food prices and a further anticipated hike , food shortages , malnutrition , and even deaths have been recorded ( Torero , 2020 ) . The United Nations World Food Program has estimated that by the end of the year 2020 , over 265 million people could suffer from food shortages and hunger ( Food Security Information Network , 2020 ) . In a national survey conducted in the United States of America , it was shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has directly increased the rate of food insecurity in households having children ( Bauer , 2020 ) . This survey showed that 34.5 % of households with a child ≤18 years old and 34.4 % of families with children ≤12 years old were experiencing food shortages by the end of April 2020 , compared with 14.7 and 15.1 % in 2018 , respectively ( Bauer , 2020 ) . It was also shown that 17.4 % of mothers with children ≤12 years old reported that “ the children in my household were not eating enough because we just couldn ’ t afford enough food , ” compared to 3.1 % in 2018 ( Bauer , 2020 ) . COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the hunger crisis in the world ’ s hunger hotspots and created new epicenters of hunger worldwide . By the end of the year , 12,000 people per day died from COVID-19 pandemic , which is linked to hunger , potentially more than the disease ( Siguerva et al. , 2020 ) . The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict , climate change , inequality , and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers . During the COVID-19 pandemic , despite the socioeconomic disparities across borders and communities , there has been expansive togetherness , love , and care . The lockdown , however , introduced several economic hardships Siguerva et al . ( 2020 ) ; Aborode et al . ( 2021b ) , such as coronavirus famine , food insecurity and adverse hunger , which triggered risk of human death . Neglecting to combat hunger may have caused severe malnutrition and starvation , as evident in war-torn or ravaged ambient . These correlated to salient risk factors or determinants Chukwuma ( 2020 ) for compromised immune systems and facilitated susceptibility to infection rates , life-threatening disorders associated with the novel coronavirus . These disorders include severe respiratory distress , pneumonia , diarrhea , cholera , other gastrointestinal diseases Chaolin et al . ( 2020 ) , and emerging and re-emerging diseases Chukwuma ( 2018 ) to poor sanitation and inadequate water supply . To mitigate the impact of hunger during COVID-19 pandemic on human lives , there is a need for COVID-19 economic recovery palliative . This will provide families with prompt and adequate access to food and other resources during and after the pandemic crisis . There is also a need for an improvement in the nutritional intake of people who are vulnerable- mostly people with low standard of living and other factors that trigger their vulnerability such as health issues ( El Zowalaty et al. , 2020 ) .

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe world is gripped by a truly global public health emergency. From New York to Wuhan, attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (officially, SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.[1] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed. As the pandemic[2] spreads, the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable, among them refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs). These populations must be included in the global response to the virus. This is essential to protecting not only these communities, but societies at large.\n\nThe scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world’s populations are. Nevertheless, at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential, many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens. But a virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.\n\n“A virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.”\n\nThe world’s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable. Already, their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways. The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live. A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe first factor is population density. Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions, including formal camps, informal settlements, or population-dense urban spaces. Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, the same cooking, and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all. Some are forced to share the same tent. In some countries, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention, often in appalling conditions. The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous.\n\nSecond, the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare. When they have access, it tends to be to primary healthcare. Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent, especially in camp settings. In addition, those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions, including malnutrition, psychosocial stress, and other infectious diseases like TB. These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThird, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging. Without critical information about the coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies. At risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick.\n\nFourth, the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak. Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis. Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies. Steps to close borders, halt transportation, and shutter businesses are interrupting supply. The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts.\n\nFinally, as governments, NGOs, and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic, the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically. Already, responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded. The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nCertainly, many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents. What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises. The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nAsia\n\nChina was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region, including to south Asia—home to some of the world’s largest populations of refugees and IDPs. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements. The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings.\n\nAfghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People\n\nAlmost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans. Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran, representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19, now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world.[3] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak.[4] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses.[5][6] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran, the situation is most dire. Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak. Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan. Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014, the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced.[7] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients.[8] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations, the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population’s humanitarian needs are massive. More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced. Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan,[9] a significant number had recently come from Iran.[10] They had entered through the city of Herat, where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness. Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s almost 39 million people might be infected.[11]\n\nRohingya Refugees\n\nHealth authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps. There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox’s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them. Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned, “the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages.”[12]\n\n“Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease.”\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies. Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention.[13] However, UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce, much less across the refugee population. The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps, undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness. Meanwhile, health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items.\n\nCommunicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal, credible communications networks. The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly. This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus. The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information.[14]\n\nRohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh.

In many cases, this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries. Though perhaps effective in combating the disease’s spread, these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries. The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent, where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. As a result, and in order to curb the spread of the disease, the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.[15] In some cases, this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place. The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability. Africa will be disproportionately impacted, as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent.\n\nThe Horn of Africa\n\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability; conflict and the threat of terrorism; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity. Now, they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29, Somalia had three, Ethiopia had 19, and Kenya had 38 confirmed cases.[16] Kenya also confirmed its first death—a 66-year-old Kenyan man who also suffered from diabetes.[17] Meanwhile, the region is home to approximately 5.3 million IDPs and 2.5 million refugees, who are likely to be hit hardest.[18]\n\nAbsent robust public education campaigns about the coronavirus, rumors and false information are spreading rapidly. Fast and accurate information is critical in areas where the health infrastructure is weak and does not have the capacity to face an outbreak. In Ethiopia, which is host to more than 900,000 refugees and more than 2.6 million IDPs,[19] popular sentiment has violently turned against foreigners, who are being blamed for spreading the disease.[20] In Ethiopia’s western Oromia region—where intercommunal violence has displaced thousands—a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services is further restricting the ability to provide information on the virus.[21] In addition to limiting information on COVID-19, this inhibits communication among families, doctors, and their patients.\n\nHealth experts are concerned that the outbreak in Somalia, with an IDP population of more than 2.6 million and more than 16,000 refugees, could be among the worst in the world.[22] Decades of conflict have ravaged the country’s health system and other institutions and governance is weak. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, controls large swaths of territory, limiting the state’s reach and humanitarian workers’ access to populations in need.[23] Because there are no kits to test for COVID-19 in the country, samples must be sent to South Africa for analysis, significantly delaying results and thus the ability to track the disease.[24]\n\nThe government in Somalia has halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings, but the measures are not well-enforced.[25] To date, Al-Shabaab does not appear to have implemented measures in the regions it controls. Meanwhile, Somalia’s sizable displaced population is particularly at risk.[26] Humanitarian workers warn that the consequences could be devastating for the 3,000 families living in Nabadoon camp, outside Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu.[27] There, a lack of access to clean water, healthcare, and information, as well as cramped living conditions, will facilitate the spread of disease should an outbreak occur. In addition, continued conflict will complicate efforts to reach affected populations as the virus spreads.\n\nCentral Africa\n\nNigeria, where over 2 million people are internally displaced in the country’s northeast, was the first central African state to report cases of the virus. As of March 29, there were 97 confirmed cases of COVID-19.[28] Neighboring Cameroon had confirmed 91 cases, as it grapples with a series of crises that have forced 922,000 of its citizens into internal displacement.[29] Both governments have more capacity than many of their neighbors and could play a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. The Nigerian government should be applauded for working with UN leadership in the country to coordinate response efforts there. Unfortunately, other governments across the region have not done likewise.\n\nCountries like Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) were reporting three cases in each country as of March 29; however, given the limitations of their health systems, it is uncertain if these are indicative of the actual trend.[30] The outbreak’s impact could be disastrous if the coronavirus spreads beyond the capital cities, especially for the displaced populations in both countries. There are more than half a million IDPs in CAR and 171,000 IDPs in Chad, as well as 468,000 refugees from neighboring countries.[31] These vulnerable populations have little access to clean water or healthcare facilities.\n\nMen stand outside a house in a district that welcomes internally displaced people (IDP) from northern Burkina Faso.

The coronavirus has the potential to put immense pressure on already strained national health services and healthcare provided by humanitarian actors. The situation in Burkina Faso provides a window into the nature of the challenge that could confront neighboring Mali and Niger. There are currently 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Eleven deaths have been reported, including that of Marie Rose Compaore, the second vice-president of the National Assembly. It is only a matter of time before the disease spreads to the country’s more than half a million IDPs.[32]\n\nAs of March 29, Mali and Niger had both reported 18 cases of COVID-19. However, the lack of infrastructure in both countries prevents both the effective detection and containment of the disease. Moreover, the internally displaced populations in both countries—171,000 people in Mali, and 187,000 in Niger—are not in camps and frequently relocate because of spreading violence.[33] This could increase the likelihood of the virus reaching them and other groups on the move.\n\nAcross the region, humanitarian funding is in short supply and displaced populations already lacks access to health services, water, and sanitation. Basic measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization—such as stringent hand washing with soap and water and social distancing—are largely impractical in this context. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had planned to host a donor conference for the Sahel in mid-June to secure badly needed funding for the emergency. However, the conference has now been postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nIn the Great Lakes Region, 30 people in Uganda, 60 in Rwanda, and 65 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had tested positive for COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020.[34] With over 5 million displaced persons (the vast majority of whom are IDPs), the DRC has the largest number of displaced people in the region.[35] The first week of March 2020 marked the end of the DRC’s two-year-long Ebola outbreak. But the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. As the DRC grapples with the spread of this new pandemic, it is important that health facilities built to respond to the Ebola outbreak be repurposed to treat cases of COVID-19. While discussions to that effect have already begun, very little action has been taken. NGOs are beginning to integrate messaging about the coronavirus into their current programs. However, planning and implementation must be accelerated.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nFollowing years of civil war, nearly one-third of South Sudan’s population remains displaced—there are about 1.47 million IDPs in South Sudan and 2.2 million refugees in neighboring countries.[36] With more than half the population facing acute food insecurity and poor health infrastructure, South Sudan is highly vulnerable to the spread and harmful effects of infectious diseases. No cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the country as of publication of this report, but several cases had been confirmed in neighboring countries. To prevent and prepare for a possible outbreak, South Sudan has suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders to all but cargo buses, food trucks, and fuel tanks.[37]\n\nThe presence of a large UN peacekeeping mission with significant staff rotations in South Sudan adds an additional potential vector for the disease to spread to the country. Almost 200,000 IDPs live in Protection of Civilian sites on or near peacekeeping bases.[38] The UN and troop contributing countries are taking steps to limit the potential for exposure, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan.[39]\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had significant implications for major humanitarian hotspots across the Americas. To date, the response by governments has varied widely. Countries like Peru, Guatemala, and Colombia implemented strong measures early to combat the spread of the virus.[40] However, Mexico and Brazil have been slow to adopt mitigation measures, even dismissing the severity of the crisis.[41] In Central America, many countries have adopted stricter border policies but have acquiesced to demands from the United States to continue receiving deported nationals. Many countries in South America have closed their borders to the movement of people, including for displaced Venezuelans.\n\nThe U.S. Border\n\nThe United States now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.[42] Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court dates there. This was done under the Trump administration’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the “Remain in Mexico” program.[43] These asylum seekers—mostly from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela—were returned to unsafe conditions in Mexico, and left to await their hearings in ill-equipped shelters and informal open-air encampments where disease could spread rapidly. In addition, there were 15,000 individuals waiting to seek asylum outside U.S. ports of entry as of February 2020. These individuals—three quarters of whom are Mexican—were living in the same grim conditions as those impacted by the MPP program.[44]\n\nOn March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures in response to the pandemic. No exceptions are being made for asylum seekers or unaccompanied minors. The border closure empowers DHS to immediately turn back to Mexico or repatriate to their home countries other than Mexico all asylum seekers without due process—a clear violation of U.S. obligations under domestic and international law.[45] These measures were instituted well after introduction of the virus to the United States. They have impeded the ability of humanitarian workers to bring critical supplies to Mexico. In addition, some of the shelters housing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border have been forced to close because of the virus.[46]\n\nAs a result of the border closures, the United States has already begun to turn away or repatriate all migrants lacking documents authorizing their entry—including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors—to countries including Mexico,[47] Guatemala,[48] Honduras,[49] and Ecuador. Authorities are not screening individuals to determine if they are victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of persecution in their home countries. Nor are they taking precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Mexican government has agreed to accept most Central American returnees (though not unaccompanied minors).[50] It is not clear if the United States or Mexico intends to arrange the deportation of others, such as Venezuelans or Cubans, in lieu of allowing them to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMoreover, many of the NGOs that typically play a crucial monitoring role at the U.S. border have been forced to reduce or cease operations in light of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. This makes it crucial that the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) monitor returns and conditions along the border. Despite U.S. government restrictions on travel and commerce, the delivery of critical humanitarian supplies to Mexico should be considered “essential” and allowed to continue.\n\nThe rule closing the border is predicated on the false assumption that the only possible alternative to turning away asylum seekers is detaining them in unsafe, overcrowded border facilities for lengthy periods of time. In fact, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency could instead expeditiously parole asylum seekers into the United States, where the vast majority have ties to families, friends, or faith-based communities.[51] In the weeks ahead, U.S. border officials should allow people to follow the U.S. legal process to request asylum and provide screening and referral to health facilities if necessary. Asylum seekers should then be released to homes and NGO-run shelters, through parole or other community-based alternatives to detention, where they can appropriately socially distance and be permitted to continue their cases in immigration court when the courts resume operations.[52] CBP should screen unaccompanied minors and send then to the Office of Refugee Resettlement which must, according to a new court order, quickly plan to release them to sponsors.[53]\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people. Asylum seekers and other forced migrants come primarily from Central America, but also from South America and Africa. They are often at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus because of their living conditions. Many are detained in detention centers known as “migratory stations,” stay in privately-run shelters while they await their asylum claims in Mexico to be processed, or, as described above, live in informal camps on the northern border while they await their court hearings in the United States.\n\nMexico has 848 registered cases of COVID-19.[54] Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for long ignoring the crisis, even traveling across the country and holding gatherings with large crowds. Now, the government has begun to take steps to contain the virus, such as calling for Mexicans to stay in their homes for a month[55] and limiting tourism.[56] It is also working to reduce overcrowding among the migrant and forcibly displaced populations in migratory stations across the country.[57] However, the government continues to accept the return of Mexicans deported from the United States despite inadequate health screenings prior to deportation. Grim conditions and the absence of healthcare and other services in the informal camps where they often stay are perhaps of greatest concern.\n\nThe Mexican authorities must more aggressively encourage practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and President López Obrador should lead by example. In migratory stations, specifically, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INAMI) should continue to implement mitigation measures and reduce the number of detained migrants when possible, with support from independent civil society organizations. The Mexican government has indicated that it would suspend the processing of asylum requests until April 20. However, it should resume these operations as soon as possible. In the interim, Mexico should ensure that asylum seekers whose claims are on hold have access to adequate shelter and healthcare, including testing for COVID-19. Mexico should not be expected to accept asylum seekers returned under the MPP program until basic safeguards can be put in place to protect the health of returnees.\n\nCentral America\n\nThe countries of Central America grapple with extreme violence and lack institutional capacity to respond to a pandemic. Civilians eager to escape violence have no recourse, prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Meanwhile, hundreds of Central Americans are deported from the United States each week.\n\nGuatemala has confirmed 34 cases COVID-19.[58] On March 16, the government suspended all international flights and closed the borders for 15 days.[59] On March 17, it announced the temporary suspension of transfers of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the United States to Guatemala under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). (The United States has used the ACA to bar asylum seekers from applying for protection in the United States, instead sending them to Guatemala.) The Guatemalan government initially announced that it would suspend the acceptance of Guatemalan nationals deported by the Unites States. However, it reversed this decision in a just a matter of days and deportations of Guatemalans have resumed. The Guatemalan government is warning its citizens that they will be immediately deported if they attempt to go to the United States.[60]\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced that the country would bar entry to all foreigners, except accredited diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for patients with COVID-19 and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the United States on March 18.[61] Nonetheless, deportation flights to El Salvador have continued.[62] As of March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the United States.[63]\n\nThe Guatemalan government should remain firm in its decision to halt transfers of asylum seekers under the ACA. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unreasonable to forcibly send Salvadorans and Hondurans asylum seekers to a country, Guatemala, that cannot provide them with adequate safety and security. In cases of deportation of Guatemalan, Salvadoran, or Honduran migrants who have not made claims to asylum, the United States should adopt comprehensive screenings prior to departures to ensure safety of other deportees and to avoid overwhelming these countries’ fragile health systems during this public health crisis. Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who test positive should not be deported.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis\n\nUnder the regime of President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have suffered years of economic collapse, institutional failure, and political turmoil. Hyperinflation, generalized violence, and political repression are rife in a country where the vast majority live in poverty. In February 2020, the UN World Food Program stated that 9.3 million people in Venezuela—about one-third of the population—faced food insecurity.[64] As more than 4.9 million people have fled the country, over 1 million children have been left without their parents.[65]\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 119 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Venezuela. Although World Health Organization records do not indicate any deaths, Venezuelan officials have confirmed at least one death.[66] A “social quarantine” has been established nation-wide, and military forces have been deployed throughout the country to enforce restrictions on movement. Nevertheless, not all citizens are complying, as small crowds continue to line up to obtain food and other essential goods. On March 24, the government ordered stricter isolation measures in the three states—Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas—that account for 70 percent of COVID-19 cases.[67] The country’s years-long economic crisis has left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse.[68] Hospitals lack adequate facilities, medical personnel, supplies, and medication.[69] For the public, face masks, soap, and even water for hand-washing[70] are either unavailable or unaffordable.[71]\n\nNicolás Maduro has called on the United States to lift its sanctions on the country in order to open access to foreign investments and finance that could help fund a response. Human rights groups, and EU leaders,[72] as well as the UN Secretary-General[73] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights[74] have echoed these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges in a move it could use to justify additional sanctions.[75] Maduro also tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from a special emergency fund of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[76] President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits,[77] and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help.[78] Meanwhile, Maduro’s long-held opposition to international aid organizations will further heighten the likelihood that the outbreak does outsized damage.\n\nThe pandemic risks exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela—a crisis that has already compelled millions from Venezuelans to seek refuge in other countries.[79] As the situation deteriorates, more Venezuelans are likely to try to flee to neighboring Colombia and Brazil. Faced with official border closings, they may instead resort to taking dangerous unofficial routes out of the country, known as trochas, that are often controlled by armed groups. Those who are able to cross irregularly will, in turn, have trouble accessing the care they need in their host countries, and thus risk further spreading the virus.\n\nVenezuelans in Colombia\n\nAs of March 29, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside Colombia had risen to 608, with six deaths reported.[80] That day, after several temporary “quarantine drills” in parts of the country, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect.[81] As of March 17, the government had closed the country’s borders. Colombia is host to the largest number of displaced Venezuelans, by far—according to official reports, more than 1.7 million Venezuelans were in Colombia as of December 31, 2019. Since the start of the displacement crisis, the Colombian government has maintained a relatively generous response.[82] However, as the international response to the Venezuelan displacement crisis remains acutely underfunded and Colombia faces its own economic challenges, the situation has begun to stress the country’s public services—including the healthcare system. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate these challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia is likely to be severe. First, despite the fact that Venezuelans have the right to free emergency healthcare in Colombia regardless of their immigration status, many cannot access that care because facilities lack capacity or because health workers are unaware of Venezuelans’ rights or even discriminate against them. Those who have regular status and are able to obtain insurance may have an easier time accessing care, and a broader range of care. Nevertheless, the majority of Venezuelans in Colombia have been unable to regularize their status. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status is only expected to increase as a result of the border closing. As indicated above, Venezuelans desperate for aid may instead resort to using informal channels to enter Colombia.[83]\n\nMany Venezuelans—including the pendulares who still live in Venezuela and cross frequently into Colombia to purchase goods or attend school—rely heavily on aid provided by international organizations and NGOs near the border. However, as part of the measures to close the border, the Colombian government ordered NGOs in the area to cut their capacity by half.[84] Moreover, on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced that gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited.[85] The restriction will inevitably impact organizations’ ability to operate in centers where Venezuelans shelter or gather to seek aid.\n\nTwo young Venezuelans with face marks cross the Rumichaca Bridge on the border between Colombia and Ecuador.

According to the latest official figures, Peru is host to the second largest number of Venezuelans (861,000 as of February 7, 2020).[86] As of December 31, 2019, Ecuador is host to 366,596 Venezuelans.\n\nOn March 15, Ecuador—where 1,823 cases and 48 deaths have now been reported—closed its borders to all foreign travelers.[87] Gatherings of more than 30 people were also banned.[88] In Peru, where 671 cases have been confirmed,[89] Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra also declared a state of emergency on March 15 and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days.[90] Four days later, the government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles.[91]On March 25, President Vizcarra extended a state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12.[92]\n\nThese border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries. For Venezuelans already inside these host countries, limited access to healthcare, loss of their livelihoods, and limits on movement and available services will put them at higher risk of infection or complications.\n\nOn March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.[93] President Bolsonaro has been criticized for his lax response to the pandemic, raising fears that the toll inside the country will be high.[94]Already, by March 25, there were 2,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths. The latest official figures indicate that Brazil was host to more than 250,000 Venezuelans as of November 30, 2019, though the current number is likely much higher. Despite the government’s attempts to relocate Venezuelans who have crossed into the country, the majority remain concentrated in remote, impoverished areas along the northern border, where resources and infrastructure are sparse.[95] The inevitable damage from the coronavirus is thus likely to affect Venezuelans inside the country even as the border closing hinders others from accessing the critical healthcare they lack in Venezuela.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2018, there were nearly 2.5 million refugees and 646,060 asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) alone.[96] As of March 17, just 10 cases had been reported among refugees and asylum seekers, all of them in Germany. Already, however, countries had begun to close their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands had shut their asylum offices.[97] In other countries, including Italy, asylum services have significantly slowed. Due to health and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, NGOs have had to suspend search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those attempting to cross from war-torn Libya.[98] Meanwhile, nationalist leaders and politicians—from Italy to Spain—have seized upon the outbreak as a false basis for xenophobic, anti-refugee rhetoric and policies.[99]\n\nItaly\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 92,472 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 10,023 deaths—more deaths than in any other country. More than ten days after ordering a strict, nationwide lockdown, with the number of deaths surging, the Italian government called in the military on March 20 to enforce its approach.[100] On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited all non-essential movement within the country.[101] Even as the number of new cases in Italy began to slow, the government was expected to extend containment measures beyond the initial April 3 deadline.[102]\n\nThe impact on refugees and asylum seekers has been significant.[103] At the end of 2018, there were nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. Heeding lockdown and “social distancing” orders is difficult for these individuals, who often work in informal jobs, live in close quarters, and rely on government and NGO assistance. On March 12, the government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals of rejected asylum requests given court closures. By law, foreigners in Italy have access to healthcare. In practice, many asylum seekers fear going to hospitals if undocumented, or face discrimination or language barriers. All this will make it harder to detect the virus in a highly vulnerable population.\n\nGreece\n\nAs of March 29, Greece confirmed 1,156 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.[104] While this is less than several other European countries, the Greek government is concerned that if it does not act quickly, it could follow the trajectory of Italy. Greece has therefore enacted a country-wide lockdown, closing hotels and suspending most international flights.[105] The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has suspended all administrative services until April 13 at the earliest. This includes registering asylum seekers, conducting interviews, adjudicating cases, and reviewing appeals.\n\nThe shutdown of the entire Greek asylum system leaves all asylum seekers in a precarious position. Arguably, no population in Greece is more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the more than 40,000 asylum seekers trapped on the Aegean Islands.[106] Conditions are appalling in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) where asylum seekers are required to live. The official RICs and their overflow areas are squalid and overcrowded, hosting approximately eight times their capacity. These areas lack basic hygiene facilities, have very few latrines, and provide minimal medical care at best. There is no running water, making frequent hand washing impractical.\n\nMigrants living in the Moria camp sew handmade protective face masks on the Greek island of Lesbos, as the country is under lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Photo by MANOLIS LAGOUTARIS/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nNGOs on the islands report that no significant steps have been taken to prepare the camps for an outbreak of the coronavirus. Instead, the government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days.[107] These measures reduce essential services in the camps, including food distributions, childcare, and servicing latrines. Relief groups have been calling on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country in order to save the lives of asylum seekers and Greek citizens alike.[108] The EU has now echoed this call to evacuate the most vulnerable asylum seekers in the camps to other areas on the islands,[109] a crucial first step to protect asylum seekers and limit the likely spread in the camps.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is fast becoming an epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Cases have escalated dramatically in Lebanon and Iran. New infections have emerged in more than half a dozen other countries in the region including Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 12 million refugees and IDPs live in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. Borders throughout the Middle East are porous, with refugees, economic migrants, and others often traveling along informal routes. Another challenge to an effective coronavirus response is the region’s weak or broken public health systems.\n\nHowever, the situation also differs significantly between countries. Turkey, with over 3.4 million Syrian refugees, has a robust healthcare system and the government is somewhat better positioned to respond to an outbreak and employ basic containment tools like contact tracing. On the other hand, Iraq and Lebanon have severely weak public health systems and are not able to adequately monitor what is going on and provide a robust public health response.\n\nThe Syria Crisis\n\nSyria’s brutal war entered its tenth year last month. More than 5.6 million have fled Syria since 2011, and over 6.5 million remain displaced inside the country.[110] The majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced Syrians lack the most basic needs, including access to healthcare. Even the most basic guidance on social distancing and personal hygiene will be difficult to follow where refugees and IDPs often live in overcrowded and unhygienic camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe situation in the northwest of Syria is of particular concern. It will be extremely challenging to launch an effective response to a coronavirus outbreak in places like Idlib province. While no confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been announced in Idlib, this appears to be largely due to the lack of testing kits. At least three people who showed symptoms of COVID-19 died in the past week, and there are several other patients with the virus symptoms who are quarantined inside hospitals, a doctor and a representative of a medical organization in Idlib told Refugees International. More than 1 million people are staying in overcrowded and unhygienic camps where it is very challenging to impose social distancing.[111] Very few people are staying home. The economic situation is such that if people do not work, they do not have the means to feed their families. Moreover, there is no authority inside Idlib that has the means to enforce preventive measures, and the various fighting factions on the ground appear to have other priorities.\n\nSyrians are seen on the mud covered road between tents at a refugee camp after heavy rain in Idlib, Syria. Syrian refugees, who have been living in the camp, face flooding, mud, and puddles due to lack of infrastructure and sewerage network. Photo by Muhammed Said/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images.\n\nMuch of the healthcare infrastructure in northwest Syria has been destroyed by the Russian and Syrian government bombing campaign. The facilities that remain will have little of the equipment required to treat coronavirus patients, such as ventilators, or to protect healthcare workers from infection as they go about their duties. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to the northwest.[112] The main challenge is that the whole area has only around 100 ventilators. Efforts to screen populations with infrared non-contact thermometers are also necessary. Any type of support for the general capacity of what remains of the medical system in northwest Syria could make a significant difference.\n\nOutside of Syria, more needs to be done now to help prepare the camps and communities that host Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Countries like Lebanon, host to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, are already experiencing significant outbreaks that are taxing their national healthcare systems. Jordan hosts the second largest Syrian refugee population per capita in the world. Because these refugees are unlikely to be a top priority for the national authorities, the international humanitarian community must step in to fill the gaps, in collaboration with host governments.\n\nIraq\n\nDecades of conflict and widespread violence have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of civilians in Iraq. According to UNHCR, more than 6.5 million people—approximately 18 percent of the population—are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children.[113] Nearly 2 million people remain displaced inside the country, the majority of whom have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Moreover, Iraq is host to around 300,000, mostly Syrian, refugees.[114] Many live inside camps where poor conditions and outdated infrastructure could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.[115]\n\nAs of March 29, 547 cases of confirmed coronavirus had been reported in Iraq.[116] However, the real number was likely much higher. The country’s health system, undermined by decades of sanctions, neglect, corruption and violence, suffers from significant gaps including shortages of supplies, equipment, and staff.[117] To prevent further spread of the virus, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights. However, security forces are struggling to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims from across the country visit shrines in the capital.[118] In addition, humanitarian actors have reported that curfews and movement restrictions are impacting the delivery of assistance to people in need.[119]\n\nHumanitarian groups in Iraq have developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response planning in the camps. Moreover, UN agencies are supporting Iraq with testing capacities and the procurement of personal protective equipment for health partners. Donors and humanitarian organizations should increase their efforts to support Iraq and the KRI government’s response. They should offer personnel support to fill staff shortages and provide the necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nYemen\n\nThe WHO announced that, so far, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Yemen.[120] However, a virus outbreak will almost certainly have a devastating effect. Yemen hosts what may be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million people in need of assistance, and nearly 3.65 million internally displaced.[121] A relentless war has decimated the country’s healthcare system. In the past few years, Yemen has witnessed the worst cholera epidemic in recent history.[122]\n\nLast week, both the Houthi rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognized government banned international flights in an attempt to keep the country free of the coronavirus.[123] The ban includes chartered medical evacuations. Despite the halt to passenger flights, the UN-led Yemen aid operation continues for the moment, with the vast majority of staff being Yemeni. The UN confirmed that seaports remain open for cargo. Yemen is largely reliant on cargo arriving by sea for imports of food, fuel, and other consumer essentials critical to civilian welfare.\n\nThe WHO is supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the coronavirus with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. However, some international relief teams have scaled back to essential staff only. A fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients to limit aid fraud has been paused.[124] Top priority, life-saving assistance such as food, water, sanitation, and health services will continue, but some less critical aid programs will be slowed. The international humanitarian community must step in to help Yemen’s medical personnel to prepare for a virus outbreak. It should particularly provide medical facilities with testing kits, medical equipment, and supplies in addition to personnel protective gear to help protect healthcare workers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe challenge of containing and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world’s most vulnerable, displaced populations is breathtaking in scope. Each humanitarian crisis will require a strategy tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the displaced population in question – a strategy that is workable in a context that will undoubtedly include significant resource constraints. That said, there are common elements across the countries and continents reviewed above, which lend themselves to key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nThe response must be inclusive: The response to COVID-19 must be inclusive if it is to be effective. International assistance to address the pandemic must reach all vulnerable populations, including the refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced. Governments receiving U.S. assistance for COVID-19 should ensure that the forcibly displaced living in both camp and non-camp settings are included in prevention and mitigation efforts. By the same token, aid for refugees and internally displaced people to address the COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to host communities in refugee-hosting areas. In short, the aim should be to improve systems for all persons regardless of nationality.\n\nEnhance communications and the flow of information: Governments and international aid groups should develop information campaigns to ensure displaced communities have accurate and current information about the coronavirus and response efforts. Where possible, they should work with local civil society and displaced persons themselves to ensure language and means of communications are easily accessible and widely disseminated. Governments should lift any phone and internet restrictions in and around displaced communities.\n\nDeploy medical personnel, supplies, and personal protective equipment: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize the deployment of qualified medical personnel to refugee, asylum seeker, and IDP-dense areas, along with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as gloves and masks for humanitarian health workers to ensure their safety in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in displacement camps. Appropriate training for existing health care personnel must occur, particularly for treatment of severe cases with limited ICU access.\n\nPrioritize hygiene and other WASH-related interventions: Donors and international aid groups should improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for refugee and internally displaced populations – especially those living in camps or camp-like settings. This should include the distribution of essential personal hygiene items including soap and disposable towels. The response should also recognize best practices for response for particularly vulnerable populations, such as women and girls.\n\nFocus on decongestion and isolation and quarantine capacities: Donors, host governments, and international aid groups should prioritize decongestion and building isolation and quarantine capacities in camps and camp-like settings. Services like food distribution and education should be restructured to avoid large gatherings. Donors and others should take steps now to support establishment of capabilities within displaced communities for implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures in accordance with best medical and public health advice and practices. Given the extremely high density of certain settings, novel strategies for “shielding” may need to be carefully attempted.\n\nBuild up testing and surveillance capabilities: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize deployment of rapid testing capability in adequate quantity to refugee and IDP settings. With respect to surveillance, the good news is that many formal camps already have epidemiological surveillance systems already in place. These need to be strengthened and adapted to screen for COVID-19, especially for all new arrivals in the camps.\n\nStop detentions and deportations of asylum seekers: Public health officials universally agree that detention in crowded facilities increases the risk of transmission for asylum seekers and immigrants in custody, along with immigration and border officials. Governments should put in place alternatives to detention polices and ensure that all migrants have access to testing and healthcare regardless of status. Deportation of any individuals without prior medical testing risks exporting the virus into countries unprepared to deal with mass outbreaks because of pre-existing crises and substantial vulnerable and marginalized populations with little access to limited healthcare systems.\n\nProtect those who fear persecution from forced return: Any restrictions that governments impose on travel should include provisions that safeguard individuals from forced return to torture or persecution. Moreover, extraordinary policy measures that impose unusual burdens for those seeking asylum should be lifted as soon as circumstances permit.

        "summary": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.\n\nIn Asia, the Iranian government faced criticism for its delayed outbreak response. On March 26, the Iranian government issued an intercity travel ban and closed schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses. Tens of thousands of Afghans began returning to Afghanistan from Iran, with a significant number of Afghanistan's confirmed COVID-19 cases originating from Iran. Afghan government officials recommended social distancing measures and instituted a daytime curfew in Herat. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s population might be infected. In Bangladesh, health authorities began developing a preparedness and response plan with UN agencies for Rohingya refugee camps, and hundreds of health workers started receiving training for disease outbreak detection and prevention. The government of Bangladesh began allowing only essential services to reach the camps.\n\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa, countries began taking precautions, including blocking flights and screening/quarantining passengers, to stop COVID-19. The UN requested nine troop-contributing countries to delay peacekeeper rotations. In the Horn of Africa, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya registered their first COVID-19 cases by March 29, and Kenya confirmed its first COVID-19 death. In Ethiopia, popular sentiment violently turned against foreigners blamed for spreading the disease, and a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services in Oromia restricted virus information dissemination. The government in Somalia halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings. Nigeria was the first central African state to report virus cases, and its government began working with UN leadership to coordinate response efforts. In the Sahel, Marie Rose Compaore, Burkina Faso's second vice-president of the National Assembly, died. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) postponed a Sahel donor conference due to COVID-19. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the two-year Ebola outbreak ended in early March 2020, followed by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. Discussions began to repurpose Ebola health facilities for COVID-19 treatment, and NGOs began integrating coronavirus messaging into their programs. South Sudan suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders (except for cargo). The UN and troop-contributing countries took steps, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan, to limit potential exposure.\n\nIn the Americas, the United States began leading the world in confirmed coronavirus cases. Before the outbreak, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico under the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP). On March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures due to the pandemic, empowering DHS to immediately turn back or repatriate all asylum seekers without due process. These U.S. measures impeded humanitarian workers from bringing critical supplies to Mexico, and some shelters for asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border were forced to close. The United States began turning away or repatriating all undocumented migrants, including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors, to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador. The Mexican government agreed to accept most Central American returnees (excluding unaccompanied minors). Many NGOs monitoring the U.S. border reduced or ceased operations due to COVID-19 efforts. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for ignoring the crisis. The Mexican government began implementing virus containment steps, including calling for stay-at-home orders and limiting tourism, and started working to reduce overcrowding in migratory stations. The Mexican government continued to accept deported Mexicans from the U.S. despite inadequate health screenings and indicated it would suspend asylum request processing until April 20. In Central America, Guatemala’s government suspended all international flights and closed borders for 15 days on March 16. On March 17, Guatemala announced the temporary suspension of Honduran and Salvadoran transfers from the U.S. under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). Guatemala initially announced suspending acceptance of deported Guatemalan nationals but reversed this decision, and deportations of Guatemalans resumed. The Guatemalan government began warning citizens of immediate deportation if they attempt to go to the U.S. In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced the country would bar entry to all foreigners except diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for COVID-19 patients and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the U.S. on March 18; however, deportation flights to El Salvador continued. By March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the U.S. In Venezuela, a “social quarantine” was established nation-wide, and military forces were deployed to enforce movement restrictions. On March 24, the Venezuelan government ordered stricter isolation measures in Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas. Nicolás Maduro called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Venezuela, with human rights groups, EU leaders, the UN Secretary-General, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights echoing these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges. Maduro tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits to Venezuela, and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help. In Colombia, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect on March 29. As of March 17, the Colombian government closed its borders. The Colombian government ordered NGOs in the border area to halve their capacity, and on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced a prohibition on gatherings of more than 50 people. In Ecuador, borders closed to all foreign travelers on March 15, and gatherings of more than 30 people were banned. In Peru, President Martín Vizcarra declared a state of emergency and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days on March 15. Four days later, Peru’s government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles. On March 25, President Vizcarra extended the state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12. On March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.\n\nIn Europe, by March 17, 10 cases were reported among refugees and asylum seekers in Germany. European countries began closing their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands shut their asylum offices, and asylum services in Italy significantly slowed. NGOs suspended search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those crossing from Libya. In Italy, the government called in the military to enforce its lockdown on March 20. On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited non-essential movement. On March 12, the Italian government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals. In Greece, a country-wide lockdown was enacted, closing hotels and suspending most international flights. The Ministry of Migration and Asylum suspended all administrative services until April 13. The Greek government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days. Relief groups called on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country, and the EU echoed this call for vulnerable asylum seekers.\n\nIn the Middle East, at least three people showing COVID-19 symptoms died in Idlib province in the past week, and several other patients with virus symptoms are quarantined. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to northwest Syria. In Iraq, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights, though security forces struggled to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims visited shrines. Humanitarian actors reported that curfews and movement restrictions impacted assistance delivery. Humanitarian groups in Iraq developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response plan for camps, and UN agencies began supporting Iraq with testing capacities and procurement of personal protective equipment. In Yemen, both Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government banned international flights last week, a ban that included chartered medical evacuations. The UN confirmed that Yemeni seaports remained open for cargo, and the UN-led Yemen aid operation continued. The WHO began supporting Yemen's national health authorities with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. Some international relief teams in Yemen scaled back to essential staff only, and a fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients was paused.",

        "ori_content": "Introduction The world is gripped by a truly global public health emergency . From New York to Wuhan , attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19 , a disease caused by the novel coronavirus ( officially , SARS-CoV-2 ) . On March 11 , 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially declared the situation a pandemic . [ 1 ] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed . As the pandemic [ 2 ] spreads , the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world ’ s most vulnerable , among them refugees , asylum seekers , and internally displaced people ( IDPs ) . These populations must be included in the global response to the virus . This is essential to protecting not only these communities , but societies at large . The scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world ’ s populations are . Nevertheless , at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential , many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens . But a virus does not respect borders . Nor does it discriminate . A truly effective response , not to mention a morally correct one , also must not discriminate . “ A virus does not respect borders . Nor does it discriminate . A truly effective response , not to mention a morally correct one , also must not discriminate. ” The world ’ s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees , asylum seekers , IDPs , and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable . Already , their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways . The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live . A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus . The first factor is population density . Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions , including formal camps , informal settlements , or population-dense urban spaces . Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom , the same cooking , and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all . Some are forced to share the same tent . In some countries , asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention , often in appalling conditions . The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous . Second , the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare . When they have access , it tends to be to primary healthcare . Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent , especially in camp settings . In addition , those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions , including malnutrition , psychosocial stress , and other infectious diseases like TB . These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus . Third , the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond . Misinformation , mistrust of authorities , the absence of communication networks , and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging . Without critical information about the coronavirus , the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection , but find themselves in violation of new policies . At risk of deportation , asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities , much less reveal themselves once they get sick . Fourth , the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak . Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus . Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis . Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies . Steps to close borders , halt transportation , and shutter businesses are interrupting supply . The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts . Finally , as governments , NGOs , and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic , the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically . Already , responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded . The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed . Certainly , many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic . However , we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees , asylum seekers , IDPs , and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents . What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises . The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic . Asia China was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic . The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region , including to south Asia—home to some of the world ’ s largest populations of refugees and IDPs . Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh , Afghan refugees in Pakistan , and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements . The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings . Afghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People Almost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans . Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran , representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world . Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19 , now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world . [ 3 ] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak . [ 4 ] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools , universities , national parks , and non-essential businesses . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran , the situation is most dire . Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak . Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan . However , decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan . Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014 , the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced . [ 7 ] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients . [ 8 ] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations , the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population ’ s humanitarian needs are massive . More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced . Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan , [ 9 ] a significant number had recently come from Iran . [ 10 ] They had entered through the city of Herat , where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness . Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat , but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded . On March 24 , Afghanistan ’ s health ministry warned that half of the country ’ s almost 39 million people might be infected . [ 11 ] Rohingya Refugees Health authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps . There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox ’ s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them . Cramped living conditions , poor water quality , and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease . A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned , “ the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages. ” [ 12 ] “ Cramped living conditions , poor water quality , and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. ” Bangladesh ’ s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies . Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention . [ 13 ] However , UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce , much less across the refugee population . The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps , undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness . Meanwhile , health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks . Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items . Communicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees ’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal , credible communications networks . The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly . This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus . The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information . [ 14 ] Rohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh . Photo by Aviva Shwayder/Refugees International . Africa Countries across sub-Saharan Africa have begun taking precautions to stop the arrival or stymie the spread of COVID-19 within their borders . In many cases , this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries . Though perhaps effective in combating the disease ’ s spread , these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries . The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent , where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees . The outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa . Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations ( UN ) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus . As a result , and in order to curb the spread of the disease , the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions . [ 15 ] In some cases , this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place . The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability . Africa will be disproportionately impacted , as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent . The Horn of Africa Even before the outbreak of COVID-19 , countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability ; conflict and the threat of terrorism ; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity . Now , they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29 , Somalia had three , Ethiopia had 19 , and Kenya had 38 confirmed"

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening lives and economies around the world.\n\nBut it has also demonstrated that human societies are capable of transforming themselves more or less overnight.\n\nFour experts say now is the time to usher in systemic economic change.\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus has forced entire countries into lockdown mode, terrified citizens around the world, and triggered a financial-market meltdown. The pandemic demands a forceful, immediate response. But in managing the crisis, governments also must look to the long term. One prominent policy blueprint with a deep time horizon is the European Commission’s European Green Deal, which offers several ways to support the communities and businesses most at risk from the current crisis.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises are coming. If we muddle through each new crisis while maintaining the same economic model that got us here, future shocks will eventually exceed the capacity of governments, financial institutions, and corporate crisis managers to respond. Indeed, the “coronacrisis” has already done so.\n\nThe Club of Rome issued a similar warning in its famous 1972 report, The Limits to Growth, and again in Beyond the Limits, a 1992 book by the lead author of that earlier report, Donella Meadows. As Meadows warned back then, humanity’s future will be defined not by a single emergency but by many separate yet related crises stemming from our failure to live sustainably. By using the Earth’s resources faster than they can be restored, and by releasing wastes and pollutants faster than they can be absorbed, we have long been setting ourselves up for disaster.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises - like climate change are coming. Image: European Comission\n\nOn one planet, all species, countries, and geopolitical issues are ultimately interconnected. We are witnessing how the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China can wreak havoc on the entire world. Like COVID-19, climate change, biodiversity loss, and financial collapses do not observe national or even physical borders. These problems can be managed only through collective action that starts long before they become full-blown crises.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call to stop exceeding the planet’s limits. After all, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change all make pandemics more likely. Deforestation drives wild animals closer to human populations, increasing the likelihood that zoonotic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 will make the cross-species leap. Likewise, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that global warming will likely accelerate the emergence of new viruses.\n\nGovernments that succeed in containing epidemics all tacitly follow the same mantra: “Follow the science and prepare for the future.” But we can do much better. Rather than simply reacting to disasters, we can use the science to design economies that will mitigate the threats of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemics. We must start investing in what matters, by laying the foundation for a green, circular economy that is anchored in nature-based solutions and geared toward the public good.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis shows us that it is possible to make transformational changes overnight. We have suddenly entered a different world with a different economy. Governments are rushing to protect their citizens medically and economically in the short term. But there is also a strong business case for using this crisis to usher in global systemic change.\n\nFor example, there is no good reason not to be phasing out fossil fuels and deploying renewable energy technologies, most of which are now globally available and already cheaper than fossil fuels in many cases. With the recent oil-price plunge, perverse fossil-fuel subsidies can and should be eliminated, as the G7 and many European countries have pledged to do by 2025.\n\nShifting from industrial to regenerative agriculture also is immediately feasible, and would allow us to sequester carbon in the soil at a rate that is sufficient to reverse the climate crisis. Moreover, doing so would turn a profit, enhance economic and environmental resilience, create jobs, and improve wellbeing in both rural and urban communities.\n\nRegenerative agriculture features prominently in many of the new economic models that are now being explored by city governments around the world – all of which are based on the principle of living within our planetary boundaries. As one of us (Raworth) argues in advancing her idea of “Doughnut Economics,” the goal should be to create a “safe and just operating space for all of humanity.” In other words, we must work within the planet’s natural limits (the outer boundary of the doughnut) while also ensuring that marginalized communities do not fall behind (into the doughnut hole).\n\nFor policymakers responding to the current crisis, the goal should be to support citizens’ livelihoods by investing in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Now is the time to start redirecting the $5.2 trillion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies every year toward green infrastructure, reforestation, and investments in a more circular, shared, regenerative, low-carbon economy.",

The pandemic demands a forceful, immediate response. But in managing the crisis, governments also must look to the long term. One prominent policy blueprint with a deep time horizon is the European Commission’s European Green Deal, which offers several ways to support the communities and businesses most at risk from the current crisis.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises are coming. If we muddle through each new crisis while maintaining the same economic model that got us here, future shocks will eventually exceed the capacity of governments, financial institutions, and corporate crisis managers to respond. Indeed, the “coronacrisis” has already done so.\n\nThe Club of Rome issued a similar warning in its famous 1972 report, The Limits to Growth, and again in Beyond the Limits, a 1992 book by the lead author of that earlier report, Donella Meadows. As Meadows warned back then, humanity’s future will be defined not by a single emergency but by many separate yet related crises stemming from our failure to live sustainably. By using the Earth’s resources faster than they can be restored, and by releasing wastes and pollutants faster than they can be absorbed, we have long been setting ourselves up for disaster.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises - like climate change are coming. Image: European Comission\n\nOn one planet, all species, countries, and geopolitical issues are ultimately interconnected. We are witnessing how the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China can wreak havoc on the entire world. Like COVID-19, climate change, biodiversity loss, and financial collapses do not observe national or even physical borders. These problems can be managed only through collective action that starts long before they become full-blown crises.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call to stop exceeding the planet’s limits. After all, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change all make pandemics more likely. Deforestation drives wild animals closer to human populations, increasing the likelihood that zoonotic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 will make the cross-species leap. Likewise, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that global warming will likely accelerate the emergence of new viruses.\n\nGovernments that succeed in containing epidemics all tacitly follow the same mantra: “Follow the science and prepare for the future.” But we can do much better. Rather than simply reacting to disasters, we can use the science to design economies that will mitigate the threats of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemics. We must start investing in what matters, by laying the foundation for a green, circular economy that is anchored in nature-based solutions and geared toward the public good.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis shows us that it is possible to make transformational changes overnight. We have suddenly entered a different world with a different economy. Governments are rushing to protect their citizens medically and economically in the short term. But there is also a strong business case for using this crisis to usher in global systemic change.\n\nFor example, there is no good reason not to be phasing out fossil fuels and deploying renewable energy technologies, most of which are now globally available and already cheaper than fossil fuels in many cases. With the recent oil-price plunge, perverse fossil-fuel subsidies can and should be eliminated, as the G7 and many European countries have pledged to do by 2025.\n\nShifting from industrial to regenerative agriculture also is immediately feasible, and would allow us to sequester carbon in the soil at a rate that is sufficient to reverse the climate crisis. Moreover, doing so would turn a profit, enhance economic and environmental resilience, create jobs, and improve wellbeing in both rural and urban communities.\n\nRegenerative agriculture features prominently in many of the new economic models that are now being explored by city governments around the world – all of which are based on the principle of living within our planetary boundaries. As one of us (Raworth) argues in advancing her idea of “Doughnut Economics,” the goal should be to create a “safe and just operating space for all of humanity.” In other words, we must work within the planet’s natural limits (the outer boundary of the doughnut) while also ensuring that marginalized communities do not fall behind (into the doughnut hole).\n\nFor policymakers responding to the current crisis, the goal should be to support citizens’ livelihoods by investing in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Now is the time to start redirecting the $5.2 trillion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies every year toward green infrastructure, reforestation, and investments in a more circular, shared, regenerative, low-carbon economy."

        "content": "The worldwide spread of the new disease known as COVID-19 has created a global health crisis unseen in modern times, triggering dramatic efforts to slow its spread. Here is what scientists know – and what they are racing to learn – about COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that is part of the coronavirus family, whose members typically cause the common cold. About 80% of people who become ill have mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough and fatigue, and recover, according to a study of 70,000 COVID-19 patients in China. About 15 to 20% develop serious illness. Those who become severely ill often develop pneumonia and difficulty breathing, and many require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited a study found that the overall death rate in China was 2.3%, but much higher death rates were seen in at-risk groups like those older than 80 years (15%) and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nPeople older than 60 years of age are at increased risk of serious illness from COVID-19, explained Nancy Messonnier, MD, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in a recent press briefing. People older than 80 have the highest risk of serious illness and death. Only 2% of the cases in the study from China occurred among children. People with underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, also have elevated risks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nWhat causes COVID-19?\n\nOn Dec. 31, the WHO was notified of a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in China. A week later, Chinese authorities identified SARS-CoV-2 as the new coronavirus causing the infections, according to the WHO. It has quickly spread around the globe, with hundreds of thousands of confirmed infections and thousands of deaths.\n\nWhat are coronaviruses?\n\nCoronaviruses sometimes cross over from animals to humans. In some cases, these coronavirus crossovers begin spreading among humans and a few have caused serious respiratory illnesses. In 2002, a coronavirus that jumped from civet cats to humans caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). A decade later, a coronavirus that crossed from dromedary camels to humans caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak. SAR-CoV disappeared by 2004, though MERS-CoV continues to circulate in camels, according to NIAID. The exact source of the currently circulating novel coronavirus is unknown, but a recent genetic analysis suggests it is most closely related to coronaviruses circulating in bats.\n\nWhy is SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous?\n\nBecause humans have never been exposed to this new coronavirus before, they have essentially no immunity, Dr. Messioner said at the press briefing. As a result, it has spread exponentially, with thousands of cases reported across all 50 states by mid-March.\n\n“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person-to-person based on the available data,” she said at the briefing. Small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person can infect others when they breathe in the droplets or touch surfaces the droplets have landed on and then touch their face, according to the WHO. People without symptoms may also spread the virus, the CDC notes, accounting for the recommendations some officials are making to drastically curb social interaction.\n\nWhy are we seeing strict public health measures in response to COVID-19?\n\nBecause the virus is so infectious and is spreading at exponential rates, public health authorities are concerned that the demand for care for people who become seriously ill could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. To help prevent this, the CDC and the federal government are working with state and local authorities on strict public health measures to slow the spread of the virus such as recommending that people avoid social gatherings with more than 10 people and suggesting that those who are not employed in critical industries work from home if they can. In some areas, officials have required bars and restaurants to close and for residents, with some exceptions, to stay home. The idea is to “flatten the curve” – to slow the rate of new infections in the population – so that fewer people become sick at once and hospitals can keep up.\n\nAre people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 immune after they recover?\n\nSo far, there are limited data available on whether people who have been infected develop immunity or if they can become reinfected. But during his testimony to Congress, NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD ‘66, said, “if this acts like any other virus once you recover, you won’t get reinfected.”\n\nHow is COVID-19 treated?\n\nThere are currently no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, so doctors are relying on supportive care to help patients recover, according to the WHO. There are also no vaccines currently available that would protect people from becoming infected. But clinical trials are underway to test potential treatments and vaccines, though they are likely months away from being widely available. For example, clinical trials are underway in China of a drug called remdesivir, which was developed to treat MERS-CoV, according to NIAID, and manufacturer Gilead will provide the drug outside of the trials for certain severely ill patients, pregnant women and children, STAT News reported.\n\nClinical studies are also underway to see whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs currently used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, or a drug called sarilumab, a drug that might reduce the lung inflammation, are safe and effective against COVID-19, according to the FDA. Some scientists, however, have urged caution about the potential use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials until data about their efficacy is confirmed. As of March 20th, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists were reporting shortages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially putting at risk patients in need of these drugs for established diseases.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has also launched an early clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said Dr. Fauci in the announcement about the vaccine trial.",

Andrew Cuomo has conveyed the magnitude of the public health crisis threatening his state and New York City, laying out the desperate plight of hospitals, the shortfall in supplies and equipment, the importance of slowing the spread of the contagion, and the overwhelming need for federal action.\n\nHaving missed the opportunity to contain COVID-19, our leaders must act to mitigate its spread and devastation. Effective action requires clear, consistent communication dictated by public health and science, not public relations. All levels of government must work together seamlessly, driven by the mission, not worries about bureaucratic turf. Action must be immediate and overwhelming. Continuing failures to fully mobilize all available federal resources and powers will add immeasurably to the human and economic toll.\n\nTime is truly of the essence. Delay costs lives. Leadership matters. It’s that simple.\n\nSteven M. Lieberman is a nonresident fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution and a retired senior federal official who has worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nFor the latest coronavirus news, visit here.\n\nFor the latest, most reliable COVID-19 insights from some of the world’s most respected global health experts, see Global Health NOW’s COVID-19 Expert Reality Check.\n\nJoin the tens of thousands of subscribers who rely on Global Health NOW summaries and exclusive articles for the latest public health news.

The decision came just days after a protest in support of a jailed politician ended in a violent clash, with police arresting numerous attendees.

The more connected people are, experts say, the less likely they are to die by suicide.

Many therapists are no longer seeing clients in person, and not everyone has insurance that will cover telemedicine.\n\n\"Isolation is a big trigger for a lot of people,\" said Norine VanderHooven, a licensed clinical social worker in California. \"With SARS or H1N1 it was on such a different scale than what we're dealing with now. People are becoming so anxious because they don't know what to expect. Anxiety is fear of the unexpected or unknown.\"\n\nDanielle Sinay, 28, is a writer in Brooklyn who has a history of suicidal thoughts. She's been diagnosed with a panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While she isn't entirely isolated – she lives with her husband and four pets – disruptions to her routine and the proliferation of unknowns have left her vulnerable.\n\n\"It's so scary, it's almost like ... I would rather be dead,\" she said. \"I mean, I wouldn't be, but sometimes I get so scared it feels like that.\"\n\nNadine Kaslow, a professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of Medicine, said not all people who have experienced suicidal thoughts or survived previous attempts will react to the pandemic the same way.\n\nIf someone's suicidality stems from insecurities about self-esteem or self-worth, for example, the pandemic may not be as impactful as it would be for someone who has an anxiety disorder or suffers from catastrophic thinking.\n\n\"There is certainly going to be a group of people who are suicidal where this is just one more stress for them,\" Kaslow said. \"For others it could be a final stress, not even COVID itself, but everything that comes with it, all the financial stresses, trying to take care of kids at home, people you love dying, getting sick – the list goes on and on.\"\n\nThe ripple effects\n\nExperts caution there is no single cause of suicide. But getting laid off, losing a safe place to live and taking on new family responsibilities are the kinds of adversity that can elevate suicide risk.\n\nSelf-isolation: What do you do when the bigger danger is at home?\n\nLooking at a past disease outbreak like SARS in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 gives some indication of what may lie ahead. Social disengagement, stress and anxiety among some older adults resulted in an exceptionally high rate of suicide deaths, according to a 2010 study. Caine said Hong Kong's disrupted economy may have lead to increased suicides. He is concerned the U.S. may see the same.\n\nResearch shows unemployment is a risk factor for suicide. Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust, a national foundation committed to advancing mental health issues, said the virus outbreak already is bringing into sharp relief risk factors for poor health such as loneliness and social isolation.\n\n“Add to these social factors the possibility of an economic downturn, which may include job loss, and we are looking at a perfect storm of problems that will only exacerbate the deaths of despair that our nation still has not addressed,\" Miller said.\n\nVanderHooven said at least one of her clients attempted suicide because of impending job loss.\n\n\"We need to normalize people's feelings,\" she said. \"The truth is we don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTaking care of one another\n\nIn a moment like this, Caine said people can mitigate risk to vulnerable populations by doing their best to care for one another. The crisis is a collective one, not an individual one. No one should have to endure it alone.\n\n\"Even in the midst of social separation, there are ways where we can pull together to bring out warmth and cohesion,\" he said.\n\nCaine is encouraged by what he's seen already. Communities are mounting efforts to identify people at risk of isolation. Churches are reaching out. Parents are setting up Facebook groups to exchange information on (and to collectively lament the challenges of) homeschooling their kids. Local organizations are helping older adults with emergency needs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a sweeping multibillion-dollar emergency aid package last week that will provide paid sick leave for Americans who are in quarantine, helping a family member who is infected with COVID-19 or have children whose schools have closed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. More economic relief plans are underway.\n\nThese efforts, Caine said, will make a difference.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced many people to question the future and to some extent their mortality. For people struggling with suicidal ideation, existential questions are familiar. But Kaslow said it's possible that for some suicidal people, the coronavirus could end up being life-saving.\n\n\"There's going to be a group of people, I imagine, who are actually going to do better because somehow they are going to find a way to do something meaningful during this time,\" she said.\n\n\"They'll have to take care of their kids in a way they didn't have to before, or they'll be the one bringing food to people who are sick. Somehow in this national global crisis, they'll find a space to do something that matters. They'll find purpose.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center has compiled specific resources to support mental health and coping with the coronavirus.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nAlia E.

Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust, a national foundation committed to advancing mental health issues, said the virus outbreak already is bringing into sharp relief risk factors for poor health such as loneliness and social isolation.\n\n“Add to these social factors the possibility of an economic downturn, which may include job loss, and we are looking at a perfect storm of problems that will only exacerbate the deaths of despair that our nation still has not addressed,\" Miller said.\n\nVanderHooven said at least one of her clients attempted suicide because of impending job loss.\n\n\"We need to normalize people's feelings,\" she said. \"The truth is we don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTaking care of one another\n\nIn a moment like this, Caine said people can mitigate risk to vulnerable populations by doing their best to care for one another. The crisis is a collective one, not an individual one. No one should have to endure it alone.\n\n\"Even in the midst of social separation, there are ways where we can pull together to bring out warmth and cohesion,\" he said.\n\nCaine is encouraged by what he's seen already. Communities are mounting efforts to identify people at risk of isolation. Churches are reaching out. Parents are setting up Facebook groups to exchange information on (and to collectively lament the challenges of) homeschooling their kids. Local organizations are helping older adults with emergency needs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a sweeping multibillion-dollar emergency aid package last week that will provide paid sick leave for Americans who are in quarantine, helping a family member who is infected with COVID-19 or have children whose schools have closed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. More economic relief plans are underway.\n\nThese efforts, Caine said, will make a difference.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced many people to question the future and to some extent their mortality. For people struggling with suicidal ideation, existential questions are familiar. But Kaslow said it's possible that for some suicidal people, the coronavirus could end up being life-saving.\n\n\"There's going to be a group of people, I imagine, who are actually going to do better because somehow they are going to find a way to do something meaningful during this time,\" she said.\n\n\"They'll have to take care of their kids in a way they didn't have to before, or they'll be the one bringing food to people who are sick. Somehow in this national global crisis, they'll find a space to do something that matters. They'll find purpose.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center has compiled specific resources to support mental health and coping with the coronavirus.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nAlia E.

        "content": "A new peer-reviewed study from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London Hospitals has found that quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccines (QIVs)—the standard annual flu shots—do not generate protective antibodies against two dangerous strains of avian influenza A(H5N1), including the version recently detected in U.S. dairy cattle and linked to human infections.\n\nPublished in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the study analyzed blood samples from 61 adults who received flu vaccines across the 2021–2024 seasons. While the vaccines effectively boosted immunity against seasonal flu viruses, they failed to trigger any meaningful immune response against the two H5N1 strains tested.\n\nNo Protection Against H5N1\n\nDespite strong responses to the seasonal H1N1 flu virus, none of the participants showed antibody responses that would help neutralize the tested H5N1 viruses—one from a 2023 outbreak in Cambodia, and one from a 2024 U.S. dairy cow linked to recent human infections. This indicates that current flu shots are unlikely to protect people from serious illness if H5N1 spreads more widely among humans.\n\nRising Risk of Human Transmission\n\nThe findings come amid growing concern that H5N1 is evolving in animals, particularly on dairy farms where the virus has been detected in cows, cats, rodents—and in some human cases. U.S. officials have also found traces of the virus in wastewater and in raw milk. While pasteurized milk remains safe, the presence of live virus in unpasteurized products adds another route of possible exposure.\n\nSome human infections so far have been mild, but the virus’s continued spread in mammals raises the risk it could adapt to spread more easily between people. If that happens, current flu vaccines won’t be enough to protect vulnerable populations.\n\nVulnerable Groups May Be at Greater Risk\n\nThe study focused on healthy adults, the group most likely to mount a strong immune response to vaccines. The lack of H5N1 protection even in this group is especially concerning, as older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and others at higher risk for severe illness would likely fare even worse if exposed to this virus.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThis research is a warning signal. Public health efforts cannot rely on seasonal flu vaccines to prevent serious illness from H5N1 if it starts spreading more widely among humans. With limited global supplies of vaccines designed specifically for H5N1, the study reinforces the need for faster development and broader access to targeted vaccines.\n\nThe authors call for:\n\nAccelerated development of H5N1-specific vaccines\n\nImproved surveillance in animals and humans\n\nFocused protection for high-risk groups\n\nAs H5N1 continues to spread in animals and cause sporadic human infections, this study underscores the urgent need to prepare for the possibility of broader transmission. Seasonal flu vaccines remain an important tool—but they won’t protect against this virus. Moving forward, pandemic preparedness will depend on the rapid development of H5-specific vaccines, improved detection systems, and targeted strategies to protect those most at risk.\n\n\n\nStevenson-Leggett P, Adams L, Greenwood D, et al.

        "content": "Trump administration cancels plans to develop a bird flu vaccine\n\ntoggle caption thianchai sitthikongsak/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nThe federal government announced Wednesday that it is canceling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's been spreading among dairy cows in the U.S., citing concerns about the safety of the mRNA technology being used.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including the H5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.\n\n\"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said.\n\nHe added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\"\n\n\"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\"\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\"\n\nThe administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.\n\n\"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.\n\n\"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed.\n\n\"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 1,072 dairy herds, more than 173 million poultry, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.",

        "content": "Vaccines Respiratory viruses Federal agencies See all topics Follow\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services is terminating a contract with drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect against bird flu amid the agency’s broader efforts to reevaluate therapies that use mRNA technology.\n\nThe contract, which was worth $590 million, was announced in mid-January, just before President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nModerna said Wednesday that an early-phase trial of its mRNA-based vaccine against H5 bird flu in about 300 healthy adults showed “a rapid, potent and durable immune response.”\n\n“While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile … and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement. ”These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.”\n\nHowever, HHS said Wednesday that the project doesn’t meet scientific or safety expectations for continued investment.\n\n“After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna’s H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,” HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement. “The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been looking to evaluate mRNA research and technology and ensure transparency, an administration official told CNN last month.\n\nMRNA technology is already used in Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s currently licensed Covid-19 vaccines, which have been found to be safe and effective. But public health experts have expressed concern that increasing anti-vaccine sentiments in general – and anti-mRNA sentiments specifically – may block people from accessing vaccines.\n\n“The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, said Wednesday on social media. “It was President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. These vaccines have been administered nearly 2 billion times to hundreds of millions of people around the world – making it one of the most widely used and widely studied vaccines in human history. They are safe and work well.\n\n“If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk.”\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a broad term that refers to several types of influenza that normally infect birds. The H5N1 virus has raised concern among health officials because it has sickened dozens of people in the United States and killed one.\n\nThe US does have vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, but they are made with older technology.\n\nIn February, Bloomberg News reported that US health officials were reevaluating the Moderna contract.\n\n“I’m very disappointed, candidly,” Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a physician and retired Air Force major general who was director of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in the Biden administration, told CNN in March. “One of the real challenges when a new pathogen emerges is that it takes time to produce therapeutics, and it takes time to produce vaccines.\n\n“So we worked very closely with industry to try and find ways to fund research and clinical trials and make sure that we had a variety of options available if this virus became more dangerous,” he said. “Because we just don’t know what’s going to happen next with this virus.”\n\nCNN’s Deidre McPhillips, Brenda Goodman and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

He has suggested that instead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers should let the virus run through the flocks. Then, he has said, farmers should identify birds that survive the illness and study them to identify the source of their immunity. Many scientists assert that would be inhumane and dangerous.\n\nLast week, Mr. Kennedy urged the Canadian authorities not to kill 400 ostriches that had been exposed to H5N1, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who oversees Medicare and Medicaid, offered to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida.\n\nMr. Kennedy has long waged a campaign against some vaccines, particularly those based on mRNA. He has incorrectly and repeatedly said that the Covid vaccines using mRNA were the “deadliest” vaccines ever made.\n\nExperts said his views were out of step with the science.\n\n“Pandemic preparedness is about being proactive, fast and adaptable — the mRNA vaccine platform is all of that,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n“The rationale given is likely fabricated and more of a function of R.F.K. Jr.’s assault on vaccines, the value of which he evades,” he added. “Canceling this contract makes the world less safe.”",

        "content": "The Trump administration’s unprecedented $500 million grant for a broadly protective flu shot has confounded vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts, who said the project was in early stages, relied on old technology, and was just one of more than 200 such efforts.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shifted the money from a pandemic preparedness fund to a vaccine development program led by two scientists whom the administration recently named to senior positions at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nUse Our Content It can be republished for free.\n\nWhile some experts were pleased that Kennedy had supported any vaccine project, they said the May 1 announcement contravened sound scientific policy, appeared arbitrary, and raised the kinds of questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged many of President Donald Trump’s actions.\n\nFocusing vast resources on a single vaccine candidate “is a little like going to the Kentucky Derby and putting all your money on one horse,” said William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “In science we normally put money on a number of different horses because we can’t be entirely sure who’s going to win.”\n\nOthers were mystified by the decision, since the candidate vaccine uses technology that was largely abandoned in the 1970s and eschews techniques developed in recent decades through funding from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department.\n\n“This is not a next-generation vaccine,” said Rick Bright, who led HHS’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, in the first Trump administration. “It’s so last-generation, or first-generation, it’s mind-blowing.”\n\nEmail Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nThe vaccine is being developed at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases by Jeffery Taubenberger, whom Trump named as acting chief of the institute in late April, and his colleague Matthew Memoli, a critic of U.S. covid-19 policy whom Trump picked to lead the NIH until April 1, when Jay Bhattacharya took office. Bhattacharya named Memoli his principal deputy.\n\nTaubenberger gained fame as an Armed Forces Institute of Pathology scientist in 1997 when his lab sequenced the genome of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, using tissue samples from U.S. troops who died in that plague. He joined the NIH in 2006.\n\nIn a May 1 news release, HHS called the Taubenberger-Memoli vaccine initiative “Generation Gold Standard,” saying it represented “a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness.” Bhattacharya said it represented a “paradigm shift.”\n\nBut the NIH vaccine-makers’ goal of creating a shot that protects against multiple or all strains of influenza — currently vaccines must be given each year to account for shifts in the virus — is not new.\n\nThen-NIAID Director Anthony Fauci launched a network of academic researchers in pursuit of a broadly protective flu vaccine in 2019. In addition to that NIH-led consortium, more than 200 flu vaccines are under development in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nMany use newer technologies, and some are at more advanced stages of human testing than the Taubenberger vaccine, whose approach appears basically the same as the one used in flu vaccines starting in 1944, Bright said.\n\nIn the news release, HHS described the vaccine as “in advanced trials” and said it would induce “robust” responses and “long-lasting protection.” But Taubenberger and his colleagues haven’t published a complete human study of the vaccine yet. A study showing the vaccine protected mice from the flu appeared in 2022.\n\nFor Operation Warp Speed, which led to the creation of the covid vaccine during Trump’s first term, government scientists reviewed detailed plans and data from academic and commercial laboratories vying for federal money, said Greg Poland, a flu expert and president of the Atria Health Academy of Science and Medicine. “If that’s happening here, it’s opaque to me,” he said.\n\nWhen asked what data beyond its press release supported the decision, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon pointed to the agency’s one-page statement. Asked whether the decision would curtail funding for the Fauci-created consortium or other universal vaccine approaches, Nixon did not specifically respond. “Generation Gold Standard is the most promising,” he said in an email.\n\nTaubenberger did not respond to a request for comment. Nixon and NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine did not respond to requests for an interview with Taubenberger or Memoli.\n\nThe HHS statement stressed that by developing the vaccine in-house, the government “ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest.” While any vaccine would eventually have to be made commercially, NIH involvement through more stages of development could give the government greater influence on any vaccine’s eventual price, Schaffner said.\n\nIf the mRNA-based covid shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech represented the cutting edge of vaccine technology, applying ultra-sophisticated approaches never before seen in an inoculation, the approach by Taubenberger and Memoli represents a blast from the past.\n\nTheir vaccine is made by inactivating influenza viruses with a carcinogenic chemical called beta-propiolactone. Scientists have used the chemical to neutralize viruses since at least the 1950s. This whole-virus inactivation method, mostly using other chemicals, was the standard way to make flu vaccines into the 1970s, when it was modified, partly because whole-virus vaccines caused high fevers or even seizures in children.\n\nThe limited published data from the Taubenberger vaccine, from an initial safety trial involving 45 patients, showed no major side effects. The scientists are testing the vaccine as a regular shot and as an intranasal spray with the idea of stopping the virus in the respiratory tract before it causes a broad infection.\n\n“The notion of a universal influenza A pandemic vaccine is a good one,” said Poland, who called Taubenberger an excellent scientist. But he added: “I’m not so sure about the platform, and the dollar amount is a puzzler. This vaccine’s in very early development.”\n\nPaul Friedrichs, a retired Air Force general who led the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in President Joe Biden’s White House, said that “giving $500 million upfront with very little data to support it is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“The technology for developing vaccines has tremendously evolved over many decades,” Friedrichs said. “Why would we go back to an approach historically associated with greater or more frequent adverse events?”\n\nThe government appeared to be transferring the money for the Taubenberger vaccine development from an existing $1.3 billion vaccine fund at Project NextGen, a mostly covid-focused program at BARDA, Friedrichs said. Most of that money was earmarked to support advanced research on covid and other viral vaccines, including those protecting against emerging diseases.\n\nIt is “very concerning that we’re de-emphasizing covid, which we may live to regret,” Poland said. “It assumes we won’t have a covid variant that escapes the current moderately high levels of covid immunity.”\n\nNixon said Project NextGen, for which some funds were earmarked for mRNA research, is under review. Kennedy is critical of mRNA vaccines, once claiming, falsely, that they are the deadliest vaccines in history.\n\nTed Ross, director of global vaccine development at the Cleveland Clinic, said he was “happy to see them investing in respiratory vaccines, including a universal flu vaccine, with all the programs they’ve been cutting.”\n\n“But I don’t think this is the only approach,” Ross said. “Other universal flu vaccines are in progress, and their success and failure are not known yet.”\n\nHis team, part of the NIAID-funded flu vaccine consortium, is using artificial intelligence and computer modeling to design vaccines that produce the broadest immunity to influenza, including seasonal and pandemic strains.\n\nAs interim director, Memoli oversaw the start of the administration’s massive cuts at the NIH, with the elimination of some 800 agency grants worth over $2 billion. More than 1,200 NIH employees have been fired, and many researchers, including Ross, are in limbo.\n\nHis lab is close to testing a candidate vaccine on people, Ross said, while waiting to find out about its NIH funding. “I’m not sure whether my contract is on the chopping block,” he said.",

        "content": "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.\n\nThe company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.\n\nThe funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.\n\nThe new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.\n\nThe cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.\n\nHe added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.\n\n\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.\n\nIn a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. Céline Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"\n\nH5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.\n\nScientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.\n\nModerna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

        "content": "Elon Musk has only been in charge of Twitter since late October. But already, he’s turned the company and its platform upside down.\n\nAmid all the chaos, it’s unclear how long Musk will even stay on as CEO of the social media company. On December 20, Musk confirmed that he will step down as chief executive of Twitter as soon as he finds a replacement, and will eventually run its “software & servers” teams. His announcement came less than two days after he ran a Twitter poll asking people if he should step down, and a clear majority voted in favor of him leaving.\n\nMusk would be leaving Twitter a more precarious company than he found it. In the past two months, Musk has gutted Twitter’s staff, reportedly including some key engineering functions, causing concerns about the site’s technical ability to stay up and running. Twitter’s advertisers, meanwhile are reportedly fleeing the platform because they’re concerned about the resurgence of hate speech under Musk’s “free speech absolutist” policies.\n\nAnd his new check mark system — Musk’s first major product update — caused chaos in the hours after its release, as newly checkmarked users flooded the app with fake accounts, impersonating figures from Nintendo’s Mario character to former US President George W. Bush.\n\nWhile Musk didn’t immediately change any of Twitter’s policies against offensive content, in the hours after Musk took over there was a notable surge in hate speech on the app. Some of the users posting felt emboldened by Musk’s “free speech absolutist” attitude, and actively tried to test the limits of what they could say on Twitter under the company’s new leadership. Others have tested the limits of Musk’s free speech stance by making fun of him personally.\n\nBut it’s not all fun and games. Many current and former employees, social media academics, and human rights advocates are concerned that Musk could change Twitter for the worse, turning it into an even more intense cesspool of negative content than it already is. Sparking further concern, Musk has suspended several accounts of prominent journalists over highly debatable claims that they “doxxed” the billionaire, which many critics saw as another sign that Musk is censoring speech he personally disagrees with. But others hope Musk can breathe new life into a platform that was already bleeding its most prolific users and, for years, has struggled to turn a profit. In a staff meeting on November 10, Musk said bankruptcy was not out of the question if Twitter doesn’t figure out a way to make more money.\n\nHere are some of the most significant ways Musk has changed the company so far.\n\nDo you currently or formerly work at Twitter and want to talk about the current situation at the company? You can contact Shirin Ghaffary confidentially at shirin.ghaffary@protonmail.com. Signal number available upon request. We can protect your anonymity.\n\nCreating uncertainty about who will run the company\n\nOn December 18, Musk ran a poll asking if he should step down from Twitter, inviting people to vote “yes” or “no.” The results were clear: 57 percent of some 17 million respondents voted “yes.”\n\nWhat’s less clear is who Musk would pick as his replacement. It’s anyone’s guess. Some floated Jared Kushner, since Musk was pictured spending time with him at the World Cup in Qatar around the time he made the poll. But Musk seems to think he’s the only one who can run Twitter, tweeting a reply on Thursday, “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.”\n\nAnd even if Musk were to step down from his day-to-day duties as CEO, he would still retain control as the the owner of the company. So while Musk has created a lot of chaos about Twitter’s leadership, he’ll still ultimately be the one in charge — unless he sells the company or makes it go bankrupt.\n\nReinstating suspended accounts\n\nFrom the beginning, Musk took over Twitter with the stated goal of making it a platform that allowed more controversial speech.\n\nA little under a month after he took over the company, Musk reinstated the account of former President Donald Trump, who was previously banned from Twitter following the the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol. The move was highly controversial, although Trump has yet to post any new tweets, saying he prefers his own social media app, Truth Social.\n\nMusk went even further in late November. He ran another poll asking whether he should “offer a general amnesty” to suspended accounts as long as they have not “broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” A day after posting the poll — and after a majority of people voted “yes” — Musk tweeted that he would start reinstating suspended accounts the following week. The move raised immediate concerns about whether bringing back users who have repeatedly violated Twitter’s hate speech policies would create a flood of abuse on the platform.\n\nIn the days prior to reinstating Trump, Musk also reinstated the accounts of comedian Kathy Griffin (who was suspended after she impersonated Musk), controversial psychologist influencer Jordan Peterson, and conservative humor news site Babylon Bee. Peterson and Babylon Bee were both suspended after tweeting anti-trans comments.\n\nThese reinstatements come despite the fact that Musk said he would wait to make any major decisions about reinstating banned accounts until he forms a “content moderation council” to advise him.\n\nGutting Twitter’s staff\n\nMusk began his reign as Twitter’s chief by firing top executives. Within hours of the deal closing, CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and head of legal policy, trust, and safety Vijaya Gadde were shown the door. On November 10, Twitter’s top privacy and security executives resigned, including Chief Information Security Officer Lea Kissner, the company’s chief privacy officer, and chief compliance officer, according to several reports. On the same day, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, who in recent days had publicly reassured people that Twitter was still following its content moderation policies, also left.\n\nThe week after he took over, Musk continued firing executives, including Twitter’s ad chief, general manager of core tech, and chief marketing officer Leslie Berland (who just a few days earlier sent a cheery note announcing that Musk was visiting the San Francisco offices). He also pulled in more than 50 Tesla engineers to work for Twitter and assembled his own circle of trusted advisers.\n\nSoon after, Musk started gutting Twitter’s rank-and-file staff. He laid off an estimated 50 percent — upward of 3,700 employees — from the company. Twitter informed its staff that layoffs would happen by 9 am PT on Friday in a company-wide email. By late Thursday evening, several employees told Recode or posted publicly on Twitter that they had already been locked out of their work email and Slack accounts without any formal notice of whether they had been laid off.\n\nThese cuts are the largest in Twitter’s history, and several current and former employees Recode spoke with are concerned that as a result Twitter’s operations as a platform could be at risk. Musk has also reportedly planned to slash $1 billion from Twitter’s infrastructure costs, such as server space, according to a report from Reuters, furthering those concerns.\n\nAdding to the chaos, Twitter’s management changed its mind about some of its cost-cutting: the company reportedly asked dozens of recently laid-off employees if they wanted to come back to work soon after the layoffs, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe day after the first round of cuts, Musk tweeted about the layoffs and discussed them at an investor conference. He framed the layoffs as necessary because before the deal, “Twitter was having pretty serious revenue challenges and cost challenges,” according to the New York Times.\n\nTwitter’s contract workers were hit heavily by another round of cuts that happened about a week later. Platformer’s Casey Newton reported that around 4,400 out of 5,500 of Twitter’s contractors were laid off, including heavy cuts to Twitter’s content moderation teams. Musk also fired at least twenty employees who posted critical messages about him on Twitter’s internal Slack channels, or who publicly challenged Musk on Twitter.\n\nSome employees are fighting back. Shortly after the initial layoffs, a group of five employees sued Twitter in a class action lawsuit, alleging the company failed to notify them of the impending layoffs as required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN Act, that requires certain employers to give a 60-day notice for mass layoffs in the US. Twitter is giving many laid-off employees full pay and benefits through at least January, although it’s not clear if this applied to all employees, particularly those outside the US, sources said.\n\nA week and a half after the first wave of layoffs, the drama intensified when Musk issued an ultimatum to employees: Work harder or quit. In a midnight email to staff, Musk wrote that, moving forward, Twitter will “need to be extremely hardcore” and require employees to work “long hours at high intensity.” The email linked to a form asking employees to confirm that they want to work at the “new Twitter” by 5 pm ET the next day; if not, they would be laid off and receive three months severance.\n\nThe ultimatum showed how Musk is trying to pare down Twitter’s staff beyond the initial layoffs that gutted half the company.\n\nBut Musk may have gone too far with his demands. In the hours before the deadline, Musk reportedly tried to convince critical employees to stay at the company.\n\nSo far, it’s been reported that 1,200 employees declined to agree to Musk’s terms and essentially mass resigned from the company.\n\nAs concerns grew from some of Twitter’s current and former employees that the site could soon break because of low levels of engineering staffing, Musk asked all engineers who “can actually write software” to meet him in person on the 10th floor of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters and show examples of recent code they were responsible for. He even encouraged staff to fly to San Francisco the same day if need be, according to emails reported by Platformer’s Zoe Schiffer. Ironically, Twitter employees had been locked out of the building until Monday for fear of sabotage, so there was confusion about how people would do this.\n\nShaking up Twitter’s internal culture\n\nMusk has been running Twitter in his own way, similar to how he runs his other companies: in an ad hoc and intense fashion. Rather than talking to his employees first, Musk often tweets whatever he’s thinking, including his plans for the company.\n\nElon’s first message to his staff was in an email sent on November 9 around midnight Pacific time, announcing that he was ending Twitter’s remote-work-for-all policy, effective within hours.\n\nMusk’s intense management style has been an adjustment for many Twitter employees who are used to a more measured, communicative, and structured work culture. One anonymous Twitter employee told the Washington Post that the work atmosphere under Elon was like “working in Trump’s White House.”\n\nEmployees are turning to private or anonymous communication platforms like Blind, Signal, and Discord to commiserate, several employees told Recode, since they no longer feel they can be candid on internal Slack or email.\n\nAnother major change Elon is making to Twitter’s internal culture is to drastically ramp up the pace at which new features are developed.\n\nNormally, product changes like the ones that Musk proposed — such as charging users for verification — would take months or even years to implement at Twitter. Now, employees are being asked to execute them almost overnight.\n\nThis could drive the kind of innovation that Twitter, a money-losing business, might need. But it could also leave staff demoralized, or worse, compromise the reliability and security the app provides to its hundreds of millions of users. Twitter already has existing problems on this front: Former Twitter head of security and internal whistleblower Peiter Zatko warned that the platform “was over a decade behind industry security standards” in September.\n\nMaking people pay for blue check marks\n\nThe first official product change Musk confirmed after taking over Twitter was to start charging $8 per month for “blue check marks,” the verification badges that Twitter currently gives to public figures like journalists, politicians, and celebrities. Musk wanted to open up check marks to more people, as long as they’re willing to pay that price.\n\nTwitter will also give your account more priority in replies, mentions, and search if you subscribe for the new service — meaning that those who don’t pay up could lose visibility on the platform.\n\nTwitter’s verification program was originally designed to make sure people really are who they say they are online. Before you got a check mark, you had to apply for one and show ID proving your real identity matched your Twitter name. That helped Twitter’s user base make sure that the account they were looking at wasn’t an imposter.\n\nNow, Musk has removed any kind of ID verification from Twitter Blue. That means anyone who pays $8 a month can pretend to be someone else, with a check mark next to their name. That’s caused major trolling, with some Twitter Blue accounts impersonating famous people like LeBron James, George W. Bush, and even Mario, the Nintendo character. Many of the new fake accounts use realistic profile photos, names, and handles, and have a check mark next to their name, so it’s hard to tell who’s real or who’s fake.\n\nElon seems to find all this amusing, replying with crying-of-laughter emojis to several tweets pointing out the fake accounts.\n\nThis change also caused major debate among notable figures who got their check mark for free — many of whom said they aren’t willing to pay to keep their verification. Fellow billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban criticized the new feature, saying Musk “killed the most valuable part of Twitter” by making it harder for him to find trustworthy information about breaking news events.\n\nAfter a group of people including comedian Kathy Griffin began trolling Musk’s new policy by changing their names to “Elon Musk” and making fun of the tech CEO, Musk suspended their accounts and announced new rules: Any Twitter accounts involved in impersonation not clearly labeled as “parody” would be immediately suspended without warning, and any verified user who changes their Twitter name will temporarily have their check mark removed.\n\nMusk also made another sudden change when he axed a new “Official” gray check mark (in addition to the blue one) rolled out on Thursday — meant to distinguish verified users who are also notable public figures. Within hours of the release, Musk tweeted that he “killed” the feature, and the new check marks left as quickly as they arrived.\n\nShortly after the feature was pulled back, Musk tweeted this explanation: “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”\n\nBut Musk announced another delay on November 21st when he said he would postpone the relaunch of the service until, “there is high confidence of stopping impersonation.”\n\nEmboldening the trolls\n\nMusk has said his primary reason for buying Twitter was to make it a haven for free speech. He’s echoed conservatives’ longstanding concerns that Twitter is politically biased against right-wing speech despite the lack of evidence of that bias.\n\nConservative politicians like former president Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) have celebrated Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter as a major win, with Trump saying he’s happy that Twitter “will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs.”\n\nBut Musk’s more laissez-faire philosophy on content moderation has also caused another group of people to celebrate: trolls spreading racist, sexist, and otherwise hateful speech.\n\nRelated Quitting Elon\n\nOne example: There was a 500 percent increase in uses of the n-word on Twitter in the 12 hours after Musk’s deal was completed, according to a study from the Network Contagion Research Institute, even though none of Twitter’s rules have changed on the matter.\n\nTwitter has said it’s working on reducing the visibility of these posts. But data points like this have spooked several major advertisers that don’t want their brand affiliated with offensive content, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, and Pfizer — who have are waiting to see more about what direction the company will take under Musk’s leadership before they resume ads.\n\nMusk has tried to calm down advertiser concerns by tweeting a public note saying that he doesn’t want Twitter to turn into a “free-for-all hellscape.” On Thursday, Musk spoke with leaders of civil rights groups like the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and Color of Change, promising them that Twitter takes hate speech seriously, and that he won’t make any major decisions about reinstating banned accounts (e.g., Trump) until after he sets up a content moderation advisory council, which he said will at least take several weeks.\n\nMusk also told civil rights leaders he would reverse his decision to limit the amount of staff who can access content moderation systems, another one of their concerns.\n\nBut civil rights leaders organizing under the banner “#StopToxicTwitter Coalition” said that Musk had failed to hold true to his promises — and ramped up their demands for major advertisers to pause all ads on the platform, Musk tweeted on Friday that Twitter had a “massive drop in revenue” due to “activist groups” who he accused of trying to “destroy free speech in America.”\n\nIt’s not just advertisers that are leaving Twitter because of Elon; there are also early signs that Elon’s takeover and the resulting negativity are causing some users to leave.\n\nOne report in MIT Technology Review estimated some 877,000 accounts were deactivated in the week after Musk’s deal closed. That’s more than double the usual number in that same time period, according to data from the firm Bot Sentinel that MIT Tech Review cited.\n\nSince taking over, Musk has claimed that, to the contrary, Twitter’s daily active users have reached all-time highs.\n\nOf course, these are all estimates, and only from a short window of time. Twitter has also been losing its most valuable “heavy tweeters” in droves for a while now, according to a leaked internal report covered by Reuters, and that predates Musk’s takeover. But time will tell whether Musk reverses or exacerbates Twitter’s existing problem of users fleeing the platform.\n\nThrowing other ideas at the wall\n\nAside from charging for Twitter verification, Musk has been planning a whole new set of changes to the platform. While none of these are confirmed yet, they’re reportedly in the works or being tested.\n\nTwitter is considering entering the payments business — an area Musk has experience in going back to his pre-PayPal days — according to a New York Times report citing paperwork filed with the US Treasury Department. It could be part of Musk’s stated ambitions to make Twitter a “superapp” called X, which could be similar to WeChat in China that’s used not just for posting messages but for things like making shopping purchases or ordering food delivery.\n\nOtherwise, it seems as though Elon is throwing a bunch of ideas out to see which ones work. As one investor in Musk’s deal, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, said at the Web Summit conference in November, he expects only 10 percent of Musk’s ideas “will stick.”\n\nSo far, many of Musk’s ideas (like Vine and paid videos) are old ones that Twitter has already tried — and failed at.\n\nOver time, it will become clear if Musk will be able to successfully resurrect these old ideas — and his new ones, like paying for a check mark — with a very different work culture and staff than Twitter had before.\n\nWe’ll keep updating this post as Musk continues to shape Twitter, for better or worse.",

On November 10, Musk fired top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and head of legal policy, trust, and safety Vijaya Gadde. Also on November 10, Twitter's top privacy, security, and trust & safety executives, including Lea Kissner and Yoel Roth, resigned or left. Musk continued firing other executives, including the ad chief, general manager of core tech, and chief marketing officer Leslie Berland. Musk pulled in over 50 Tesla engineers to work for Twitter. Musk laid off an estimated 50% (over 3,700) of Twitter's staff, informing them via email but locking some out of accounts before formal notice. Twitter reportedly asked dozens of recently laid-off employees to return to work. Approximately 4,400 Twitter contractors were laid off in a second round of cuts. Musk fired at least 20 employees for critical posts. Five employees filed a class action lawsuit against Twitter over layoff notification. Musk issued an ultimatum requiring employees to work \"extremely hardcore\" or resign, leading to approximately 1,200 employee resignations. Musk requested engineers to meet him in person to show recent code examples.\n\nMusk confirmed charging $8/month for blue check marks and removed ID verification from Twitter Blue. The new check mark system led to widespread impersonation and chaos. Musk suspended accounts impersonating him and announced new rules against impersonation, including temporary check mark removal for name changes. Musk axed the new \"Official\" gray check mark feature hours after its rollout. On November 21, Musk postponed the Twitter Blue relaunch due to impersonation concerns.\n\nA notable surge in hate speech occurred on the app after Musk took over, including a 500% increase in the use of the n-word. Major advertisers, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, and Pfizer, paused ads on Twitter. Musk tweeted a public note to calm advertiser concerns and later tweeted Twitter had a \"massive drop in revenue\" due to \"activist groups.\" Musk met with civil rights leaders, promising to address hate speech, establish a content moderation council, and reverse staff limits on content moderation systems.\n\nMusk suspended accounts of prominent journalists. Musk reinstated former President Donald Trump's account. Musk ran a poll asking about \"general amnesty\" for suspended accounts; a majority voted yes. Based on the poll, Musk tweeted he would start reinstating suspended accounts. Musk reinstated accounts of Kathy Griffin, Jordan Peterson, and Babylon Bee.\n\nOn November 10, Musk stated bankruptcy was possible for Twitter if it didn't increase revenue. On December 18, Musk ran a Twitter poll asking if he should step down as CEO, with a majority voting yes. On December 20, Musk confirmed he will step down as CEO upon finding a replacement and will manage software/servers teams. Approximately 877,000 accounts were deactivated on Twitter in the week after Musk's deal closed. Twitter is considering entering the payments business.",

Amid all the chaos , it ’ s unclear how long Musk will even stay on as CEO of the social media company . On December 20 , Musk confirmed that he will step down as chief executive of Twitter as soon as he finds a replacement , and will eventually run its “ software & servers ” teams . His announcement came less than two days after he ran a Twitter poll asking people if he should step down , and a clear majority voted in favor of him leaving . Musk would be leaving Twitter a more precarious company than he found it . In the past two months , Musk has gutted Twitter ’ s staff , reportedly including some key engineering functions , causing concerns about the site ’ s technical ability to stay up and running . Twitter ’ s advertisers , meanwhile are reportedly fleeing the platform because they ’ re concerned about the resurgence of hate speech under Musk ’ s “ free speech absolutist ” policies . And his new check mark system — Musk ’ s first major product update — caused chaos in the hours after its release , as newly checkmarked users flooded the app with fake accounts , impersonating figures from Nintendo ’ s Mario character to former US President George W. Bush . While Musk didn ’ t immediately change any of Twitter ’ s policies against offensive content , in the hours after Musk took over there was a notable surge in hate speech on the app . Some of the users posting felt emboldened by Musk ’ s “ free speech absolutist ” attitude , and actively tried to test the limits of what they could say on Twitter under the company ’ s new leadership . Others have tested the limits of Musk ’ s free speech stance by making fun of him personally . But it ’ s not all fun and games . Many current and former employees , social media academics , and human rights advocates are concerned that Musk could change Twitter for the worse , turning it into an even more intense cesspool of negative content than it already is . Sparking further concern , Musk has suspended several accounts of prominent journalists over highly debatable claims that they “ doxxed ” the billionaire , which many critics saw as another sign that Musk is censoring speech he personally disagrees with . But others hope Musk can breathe new life into a platform that was already bleeding its most prolific users and , for years , has struggled to turn a profit . In a staff meeting on November 10 , Musk said bankruptcy was not out of the question if Twitter doesn ’ t figure out a way to make more money . Here are some of the most significant ways Musk has changed the company so far . Do you currently or formerly work at Twitter and want to talk about the current situation at the company ? You can contact Shirin Ghaffary confidentially at shirin.ghaffary @ protonmail.com . Signal number available upon request . We can protect your anonymity . Creating uncertainty about who will run the company On December 18 , Musk ran a poll asking if he should step down from Twitter , inviting people to vote “ yes ” or “ no. ” The results were clear : 57 percent of some 17 million respondents voted “ yes. ” What ’ s less clear is who Musk would pick as his replacement . It ’ s anyone ’ s guess . Some floated Jared Kushner , since Musk was pictured spending time with him at the World Cup in Qatar around the time he made the poll . But Musk seems to think he ’ s the only one who can run Twitter , tweeting a reply on Thursday , “ No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive . There is no successor. ” And even if Musk were to step down from his day-to-day duties as CEO , he would still retain control as the the owner of the company . So while Musk has created a lot of chaos about Twitter ’ s leadership , he ’ ll still ultimately be the one in charge — unless he sells the company or makes it go bankrupt . Reinstating suspended accounts From the beginning , Musk took over Twitter with the stated goal of making it a platform that allowed more controversial speech . A little under a month after he took over the company , Musk reinstated the account of former President Donald Trump , who was previously banned from Twitter following the the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol . The move was highly controversial , although Trump has yet to post any new tweets , saying he prefers his own social media app , Truth Social . Musk went even further in late November . He ran another poll asking whether he should “ offer a general amnesty ” to suspended accounts as long as they have not “ broken the law or engaged in egregious spam. ” A day after posting the poll — and after a majority of people voted “ yes ” — Musk tweeted that he would start reinstating suspended accounts the following week . The move raised immediate concerns about whether bringing back users who have repeatedly violated Twitter ’ s hate speech policies would create a flood of abuse on the platform . In the days prior to reinstating Trump , Musk also reinstated the accounts of comedian Kathy Griffin ( who was suspended after she impersonated Musk ) , controversial psychologist influencer Jordan Peterson , and conservative humor news site Babylon Bee . Peterson and Babylon Bee were both suspended after tweeting anti-trans comments . These reinstatements come despite the fact that Musk said he would wait to make any major decisions about reinstating banned accounts until he forms a “ content moderation council ” to advise him . Gutting Twitter ’ s staff Musk began his reign as Twitter ’ s chief by firing top executives . Within hours of the deal closing , CEO Parag Agrawal , CFO Ned Segal , and head of legal policy , trust , and safety Vijaya Gadde were shown the door . On November 10 , Twitter ’ s top privacy and security executives resigned , including Chief Information Security Officer Lea Kissner , the company ’ s chief privacy officer , and chief compliance officer , according to several reports . On the same day , Twitter ’ s head of trust and safety , Yoel Roth , who in recent days had publicly reassured people that Twitter was still following its content moderation policies , also left . The week after he took over , Musk continued firing executives , including Twitter ’ s ad chief , general manager of core tech , and chief marketing officer Leslie Berland ( who just a few days earlier sent a cheery note announcing that Musk was visiting the San Francisco offices ) . He also pulled in more than 50 Tesla engineers to work for Twitter and assembled his own circle of trusted advisers . Soon after , Musk started gutting Twitter ’ s rank-and-file staff . He laid off an estimated 50 percent — upward of 3,700 employees — from the company . Twitter informed its staff that layoffs would happen by 9 am PT on Friday in a company-wide email . By late Thursday evening , several employees told Recode or posted publicly on Twitter that they had already been locked out of their work email and Slack accounts without any formal notice of whether they had been laid off . These cuts are the largest in Twitter ’ s history , and several current and former employees Recode spoke with are concerned that as a result Twitter ’ s operations as a platform could be at risk . Musk has also reportedly planned to slash $ 1 billion from Twitter ’ s infrastructure costs , such as server space , according to a report from Reuters , furthering those concerns . Adding to the chaos , Twitter ’ s management changed its mind about some of its cost-cutting : the company reportedly asked dozens of recently laid-off employees if they wanted to come back to work soon after the layoffs , according to a report from Bloomberg . The day after the first round of cuts , Musk tweeted about the layoffs and discussed them at an investor conference . He framed the layoffs as necessary because before the deal , “ Twitter was having pretty serious revenue challenges and cost challenges , ” according to the New York Times . Twitter ’ s contract workers were hit heavily by another round of cuts that happened about a week later . Platformer ’ s Casey Newton reported that around 4,400 out of 5,500 of Twitter ’ s contractors were laid off , including heavy cuts to Twitter ’ s content moderation teams . Musk also fired at least twenty employees who posted critical messages about him on Twitter ’ s internal Slack channels , or who publicly challenged Musk on Twitter . Some employees are fighting back . Shortly after the initial layoffs , a group of five employees sued Twitter in a class action lawsuit , alleging the company failed to notify them of the impending layoffs as required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act , or WARN Act , that requires certain employers to give a 60-day notice for mass layoffs in the US . Twitter is giving many laid-off employees full pay and benefits through at least January , although it ’ s not clear if this applied to all employees , particularly those outside the US , sources said . A week and a half after the first wave of layoffs , the drama intensified when Musk issued an ultimatum to employees : Work harder or quit . In a midnight email to staff , Musk wrote that , moving forward , Twitter will “ need to be extremely hardcore ” and require employees to work “ long hours at high intensity. ” The email linked to a form asking employees to confirm that they want to work at the “ new Twitter ” by 5 pm ET the next day ; if not , they would be laid off and receive three months severance . The ultimatum showed how Musk is trying to pare down Twitter ’ s staff beyond the initial layoffs that gutted half the company . But Musk may have gone too far with his demands . In the hours before the deadline , Musk reportedly tried to convince critical employees to stay at the company . So far , it ’ s been reported that 1,200 employees declined to agree to Musk ’ s terms and essentially mass resigned from the company . As concerns grew from some of Twitter ’ s current and former employees that the site could soon break because of low levels of engineering staffing , Musk asked all engineers who “ can actually write software ” to meet him in person on the 10th floor of Twitter ’ s San Francisco headquarters and show examples of recent code they were responsible for . He even encouraged staff to fly to San Francisco the same day if need be , according to emails reported by Platformer ’ s Zoe Schiffer . Ironically , Twitter employees had been locked out of the building until Monday for fear of sabotage , so there was"

The company was benefiting from a flood of funding into the social-networking space, eventually leading to an IPO in 2013 that raised $1.8 billion.\n\nNow the company is back in private hands. And they happen to be the hands of Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and one of the app's most high-profile provocateurs.\n\nIt's a massive moment. Twitter has become a key place for people to debate, joke and pontificate in their own circles of politics, sports, tech and finance.

But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October.

        "ori_content": "Elon Musk takes control of Twitter and immediately ousts top executives\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer/AP Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nElon Musk has taken control of Twitter and ousted the CEO, chief financial officer and the company's top lawyer, two people familiar with the deal said Thursday night.\n\nThe people wouldn't say if all the paperwork for the deal, originally valued at $44 billion, had been signed or if the deal has closed. But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October. It is the latest step in a battle that began in April with Musk signing a deal to acquire Twitter, then tried to back out of it, leading Twitter to sue the Tesla CEO to force him to go through with the acquisition.

        "content": "In a strategic move to reinforce its presence in the decentralized social networking landscape, MaskDAO has completed the acquisition of Orb.club, a rapidly growing Web3-native social platform. The integration aims to advance MaskDAO’s broader mission of fostering a more expressive, interconnected, and user-owned digital experience, as outlined by its parent entity, Mask Network.\n\nOrb.club, which has gained notable traction for its engaging features such as viral sticker campaigns, collectible content, and in-app tipping functionalities, reported more than 50,000 monthly active users by the beginning of 2025. With its unique take on social interaction, the platform has carved out a distinctive position within the Web3 social media domain. The recent acquisition is poised to boost MaskDAO’s ecosystem by leveraging Orb’s innovation and user engagement strategies.\n\nEnhancing a Diverse Decentralized Portfolio\n\nThe acquisition brings Orb.club into the fold of an already robust network of MaskDAO-managed projects, which includes initiatives such as Next.ID, Web3.bio, and Firefly.social. Observers expect the move to not only enhance MaskDAO’s existing offerings but also accelerate the development of a fully decentralized and user-centric social ecosystem. The organization sees the integration as a natural extension of its mission to provide alternative, ownership-driven online experiences.\n\nMask Network, the founding entity behind MaskDAO, has undergone a considerable transformation since its launch in 2017. Initially conceived as a browser extension bridging Web2 and Web3 services, it has since evolved into a significant player in decentralized social media. Industry insiders have referred to it as the “Tencent of Web3,” due to its ambitious scope and growing influence. Through the creation of shared digital infrastructure, investments in onchain applications, and initiatives aimed at promoting user autonomy, Mask Network has positioned itself as a central figure in the next-generation internet. The establishment of MaskDAO in early 2025 served to further decentralize governance and reinforce its expanding ecosystem.\n\nOrb.club’s Role in the Future of Social Interaction\n\nJoining the MaskDAO network is expected to provide Orb.club with access to advanced infrastructure and a broader user base. Known for its prioritization of self-expression, user ownership, and gamified engagement, the platform has introduced a novel approach to online social interactions. Its content-driven economy has empowered both creators and users to participate meaningfully while also reaping economic benefits from their contributions.\n\nIn the context of recent developments like the launch of the Lens Chain by the Avara team, Orb’s mobile application is expected to become a primary destination for discovering trending onchain content. One of Orb’s standout features, Orb Clubs, facilitates the creation of community-centric micro-networks that allow participants to earn through engagement rather than through traditional metrics like follower counts or token speculation. This model emphasizes meaningful connection and rewards user involvement with actual ownership stakes and incentives.\n\nStrategic Vision for the Future of Web3 Social\n\nSuji Yan, the founder of Mask Network and MaskDAO, expressed a forward-looking view on the acquisition, indicating that the inclusion of Orb would reinvigorate the concept of online community in the Web3 space. He emphasized that the platform’s focus on creator monetization and community-driven models had redefined how users find joy and purpose in online interactions. The acquisition is considered a pivotal step toward MaskDAO’s aspiration to become a comprehensive hub for decentralized applications spanning identity, content, and user interaction.\n\nThe alignment between MaskDAO’s long-term vision and Orb.club’s innovative approach to social engagement underscores a shared belief in the transformative potential of decentralized technologies. As the ecosystem continues to grow, industry stakeholders will likely monitor how this integration shapes the broader Web3 social media environment.",

        "content": "System dynamics evolutionary game modeling\n\nAt its core, the “driving force” for the evolution of gamers’ strategies is the Darwinian principle of natural selection. This means that strategies demonstrating a high level of fitness have the potential to spread within the population through processes such as imitation, learning, replication, or contagion at the individual level. On the contrary, strategies with a low fitness level are more likely to be eliminated by natural selection. As these strategies evolve within the population, they give rise to various long-term dynamical behaviors at the system level72. System Dynamics is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of complex systems, which enables us to learn about individual decisions from a wider system perspective73. By adopting this approach, we can gain more precise insights into the strategic choices made by each participant and depict their decision-making processes more accurately.\n\nBy using the replication dynamic equations of the local government and resettlers, as well as the correlation and dynamics between each subject’s strategy choices and their perceived benefit function, the previous part clarified the learning evolution mechanism. We use the VENSIM PLE 10.2.2 software to build a system dynamics (SD) model for the evolutionary game involving water conservancy project relocation and resettlement stakeholders in order to perform a more thorough analysis of the strategic interaction among the game subjects based on the game model mentioned above and the perceived benefit function of each subject. This SD model is built using the system flow diagram, which allows us to visually represent the intricate influences and feedback mechanisms between the game subjects74. This model is determined by a perceived benefit function containing two state variables: the local government’s positive implementation of the relocation and resettlement policy \\(a\\) and resettlers’ voluntary migration \\(b\\). There are two rate variables: the rate of change of the local government’s implementation efforts and the rate of change of resettlers’ willingness to migrate. The model includes four auxiliary variables, denoted as \\(V_{a1} ,V_{a2}\\) and \\(V_{b1} ,V_{b2}\\), and 15 external variables. The functions of state, rate, middle, and outer variables are represented by streamlines. In Fig. 7, the red and green flow lines represent the function of the state, the external variables, and the perceived benefit function related to the government’s active or passive policy. The yellow and blue flow lines show the relationship between the state variables, the external variables, and the perceived benefit functions associated with the resettlers. Finally, the black streamlines illustrate the functional relationship between the state, intermediate, and rate variables. These streamlines help elucidate the relationship between the state variables, intermediate variables, rate variables, and the perceived benefit function associated with resettlers’ voluntary or passive migration within the model.\n\nFig. 7 System dynamics model of the evolutionary game between local government and resettlers. Full size image\n\nNumerical simulation analysis\n\nThe study data for the numerical simulation modeling were obtained from the resettlement case report of the Qianping Reservoir. It is worth noting that some parameters in the analysis are abstract and challenging to obtain. However, the parameter setup should primarily reflect the relationship between variables without influencing the research findings. To ensure the rationality of the parameters, and while adhering to the inequalities outlined in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 above, according to the project data and the existing literature on the parameter assignment method75,76 for reference, and after the water conservancy project relocation and resettlement of experts in the consulting and correction, through the calculation of the perceived value, simplified set the initial parameter values of the model auxiliary variables in Table 6. Where the values are set for each coefficient of the PT-MA function according to the assignments in the literature66,77 : \\(U_{1} = 1.5\\),\\(U_{2} = 2\\),\\(\\varepsilon ,\\eta = 0.98\\),\\(\\kappa ,\\sigma = 0.88\\),\\(\\delta ,\\zeta = 2\\),\\(\\mu = 0.61\\),\\(\\vartheta = 0.69\\).\n\nTable 6 Initial setting values of model parameters. Full size table\n\nBased on the evolution results depicted in Fig. 8a under Scenario 1, it can be observed that the initial willingness of both parties is \\(a = 0.9,b = 0.9\\), which aligns with the determination of the evolutionarily stable strategy point in Table 4. This outcome is consistent with the analysis findings of Scenario 1. The stable state for both parties is achieved at \\(E_{a} (0,0)\\). Thus, in this parameter setting, increasing the initial willingness beyond this point will not lead to a stable state at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). In Scenario 2, when the initial willingness of both parties is \\(a = 0.1,b = 0.1\\), the evolution results of their strategy selection are displayed in Fig. 8b. It is evident that both parties reach a stable state at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). This outcome corresponds with the analysis results of Scenario 2, indicating that even a lower initial willingness can result in stabilization at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). Therefore, the subsequent study will continue with the parameter setting of Scenario 1. It will analyze the impact of external variables on the strategy choices of each subject and examine the changing trends by manipulating the probability of strategy choice and adjusting the parameter setting of external variables. This aim is to explore how to optimize the evolution results from Scenario 1 to resemble those of Scenario 2 through adjustments in external variables. This optimization is intended to enable decision-makers to attain the strategy choices of both parties, even with a lower initial willingness, thereby actively promote the operation of the work.\n\nFig. 8 Effect of different parameter assignments on strategy selection. Full size image\n\nThe control variable method is employed to solely modify the probability of the initial willingness of one subject to evolve, enabling observation of the impact on the other subject. As illustrated in Fig. 9(a), by setting \\(a,b = \\{ (0.9,0.1),(0.5,0.1)\\}\\), when the probability of the local government’s inclination towards positive implementation progressively increases, the number of iterations required for the strategic choice of resettlers to reach the evolutionary steady state also increases. This leads to a slower evolutionary process. However, both parties ultimately tend to adopt a negative strategic choice regarding expropriation and resettlement, which only shortens the rate of their reaching the steady state. Conversely, adjusting the probability of voluntary migration of resettlers, as depicted in Fig. 9(b) with the setting \\(a,b = \\{ (0.1,0.9),(0.1,0.5)\\}\\) , has the minimal effect on the rate of change in the strategic choices of the local government. It also fails to create a distinction in their strategic choices. The basic tenet of evolutionary games dictates this: rather than using the initial ratio, the main body’s strategy will be selected or removed based on its success and profit42.\n\nFig. 9 Effect of different initial probabilities on strategy selection. Full size image\n\nNumerical sensitivity analysis\n\nThe analyses of scenarios 1 and 2 reveal that the value of each variable or parameter in the system dynamics determines the steady state reached by the system. In the following exploration, the impact of modifying the values of the more sensitive variables on the strategy choices of each subject is examined using the state variable \\(a = 0.5,b = 0.5\\) of both parties as an example.\n\nImpact of negative implementation policy cost\n\nThe influence of changes in the cost associated with passive implementation of policies by the local government \\(C_{3} ,C_{4}\\) on the subject’s evolutionary behavior is investigated. Let \\(C_{3} ,C_{4} = \\{ (1.4,1.6),(1.2,1.4),(1.0,1.2),(0.8,1.0)\\}\\), the evolutionary results for the local government are shown in Fig. 10a, where the greater the cost of negative implementation, the more the local government tends to favour the strategic choice of actively implementing the policy. The gradual increase in costs makes the relative attractiveness of negative implementation policies decrease. In parallel, when the local government adopts a positive policy of implementation, they are able to obtain more financial support (compensation fees, investment in resource development, etc.) from higher levels of government and promote long-term gains from social and economic stability. Therefore, the local government are more inclined to adopt an active implementation strategy to maximise their long-term benefits. Figure 10b shows the strategic choices of resettlers in the same situation, which has little impact on resettlers. This is due to the fact that although the behaviour of the local government affects the migration compensation and resettlement conditions, the resettlers are faced with the perception of risk, fairness of compensation and improvement or deterioration of the living environment, and then still makes decisions based on their own risk-tolerance and expectations of their future lives.\n\nFig. 10 Simulation results for the change in negative implementation policy cost. Full size image\n\nImpact of incentives and disincentives\n\nThe impact of modifying the rewards for due diligence positive implementation \\(S_{2}\\) and the penalties for dereliction of duty passive implementation \\(T_{2}\\) by the local government on the evolutionary behavior of the local government. The simulation results for \\(S_{2} = \\{ 1.4,1.1,0.8,0.5\\}\\) are depicted in Fig. 11a. As the due diligence reward increases, the local government tends to slow down the rate of the passive implementation. When \\(S_{2} = 1.4\\), the strategy choice shifts from passive implementation to positive implementation. Rewards enable the local government to gain more political capital, economic benefits and social recognition from them, and it directly affects the local government’s goal of maximising revenue, and also reflects the recognition of the local government’s work by higher levels of government, which increases the motivation of the local government to implement policies. Setting \\(T_{2} = \\{ 1.7,1.4,1.1,0.8\\}\\), the evolutionary outcomes shown in Fig. 11b exhibit a similarity to the results in Fig. 11a. Punishment makes the local government have a clear expectation of the cost of negative implementation policies, and thus tend to choose positive implementation policies to avoid punishment as much as possible. Therefore, the higher-level government can set up a corresponding reward and punishment system, so that the two complement each other, effectively incentivising the local government to adopt a positive implementation strategy in the implementation of water conservancy project relocation and resettlement process, thus reducing the possibility of social stability risks.\n\nFig. 11 Simulation results of the impact of changes in \\(S_{2} ,T_{2}\\) on the local government. Full size image\n\nImpact of psychological perceived value\n\nThe influence of psychological perceived value \\(U_{1} ,U_{2}\\) on the evolution of subjects is examined by evolving \\(U_{1} = \\{ 2.0,1.5,1.0,0.5\\}\\) and subsequently modifying \\(U_{2} = \\{ 2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0\\}\\). The simulation results for the local government and resettlers are presented in Fig. 12. As the reference value of the payment account \\(U_{1}\\) decreases, the local government transitions from a passive policy implementation approach to an active one. Meanwhile, the rate at which resettlers converge towards involuntary migration slows down, but does not alter their strategy choices. As the reference value of the gain account \\(U_{2}\\) decreases, the local government gradually converges towards 1, reaching a stable state, and resettlers shift their attitude from involuntary migration to voluntary migration. This suggests that resettlers usually feel a strong sense of anxiety and unease when faced with evictions because they not only lose their homes but also face an uncertain future. Resettlers’ anxiety and homeland attachment complexes are more complex, making them more resistant to changing the status quo. Therefore, resettlers’ strategic choices do not only depend on the local government’s compensation payments, but also include psychological expectations about quality of life and social identity, which largely determine whether they change from involuntary to voluntary migration. The local government, when implementing the policy, not only has to pay financial compensation, but also has to bear the time, energy and emotional costs of management and coordination. Changes in the reference values of the payment account and the benefit account will have a significant effect on the local government, though, as the seamless execution of the relocation and resettlement work and the enhancement of the resettlers’ life satisfaction will also increase the happiness of the local government.\n\nFig. 12 Simulation results for the variation of \\(U_{1} ,U_{2}\\). Full size image\n\nImpact of the risk of passive participation of resettlers\n\nIn situations where resettlers’ participation is involuntary, the local government is compelled to address issues related to social disorder and value perception \\(T_{3}\\) through measures such as price increases. During this period, resettlers are required to bear the additional risk \\(T_{4}\\) associated with the evolution of the subject. Let \\(T_{3} = \\{ 2.0,1.6,1.2,0.8\\}\\), the results of the evolution are depicted in Fig. 13a. As the local government raises prices to a greater extent, resettlers exhibit an increased desire to benefit from the system, resulting in a faster rate of convergence towards a stable state under passive participation. The strategy choice of the local government is minimally affected, suggesting that the monetary investment required to mitigate social disorder through measures like price increases is not a primary factor driving their decision towards active implementation. Moreover, when setting \\(T_{4} = \\{ 1.5,1.1,0.7,0.3\\}\\), the evolutionary outcomes are shown in Fig. 13b. The risks that resettlers have to bear when they migrate passively include, not only the safety of their lives and property, but also the uncertainty of their social identity in the midst of chaos, competition for social resources and an unfavourable external environment. Although the choice of voluntary migration may imply stress and discomfort in the short term, in the long term, the strategic choice of resettlers will shift from the previous involuntary migration to voluntary migration when resettlers realise that they can obtain better economic and social compensation and reduce the risk of social conflict and personal security through voluntary migration.\n\nFig. 13 Simulation results for the variation of \\(T_{3} ,T_{4}\\). Full size image\n\nImpact of synergistic gains and distribution ratio\n\nThe impact of changes in additional synergistic gains on social order stability during the migration process \\(S_{4}\\) and its distribution ratio \\(\\rho\\) on the evolutionary behavior of subjects. Initially, we only considered changes to \\(S_{4} = \\{ 3.0,2.2,1.4,0.6\\}\\).The simulation results of the local government and resettlers are shown in Fig. 14a. Synergistic gains are expressed as mutual benefits such as social stability, economic development and environmental improvement achieved through cooperation. When the construction of water conservancy projects is completed to effectively prevent floods and improve irrigation, both the local government and migrant groups will benefit. This leads to more active implementation of resettlement programmes by the local government and more willingness of migrant groups to migrate voluntarily. Next, we take \\(S_{4} = 3.0\\), set \\(\\rho = \\{ 0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8\\}\\). It is known that when the allocation ratio increases, i.e., the local government has a large gain, and vice versa, i.e., the migrant population has a large gain, and the evolution process is shown in Fig. 14b. The proportion of gains directly affects the distribution of gains between the two parties, which in turn affects their behaviour. When the local government has a larger gain, it is more motivated to promote migration, but the voluntary participation of migrants is lower; on the contrary, when the gain of migrants is larger, migrants are more willing to migrate voluntarily, but the local government may lack sufficient incentives, which leads to a lower motivation for implementation. The benefits to migrants can be appropriately increased in the early stages of migration to incentivise their active participation in migration. As the migration programme progresses, the distribution of benefits between the Government and migrants can be gradually adjusted so that the interests of both parties continue to be balanced.\n\nFig. 14 Simulation results for the variation of \\(S_{4} ,\\rho\\). Full size image\n\nAnalysis of the system feedback structure\n\nSystem dynamics posits that a system’s behavioral patterns are influenced by the information feedback mechanism operating within the system. The analysis of the feedback mechanism between the local government and resettlers, and the simulation results provides insights into the system-subject feedback relationship. Figure 15 illustrates this relationship, combining the findings from the simulation analysis.\n\nFig. 15 Feedback mechanism between game subjects. Full size image\n\nThroughout the process of evolution, a mutually reinforcing cycle emerges between the local government’s “active implementation” and resettlers’ “voluntary participation”\\(D\\). This means that if the local government takes proactive measures such as implementing expropriation and resettlement policies, increasing compensation and resettlement benefits for resettlers, and effectively publicizing these plans to them, while also enhancing their living standards through infrastructure development in the resettlement area, the trust of resettlers has in the local government will grow. Consequently, when the local government actively implements expropriation and resettlement policies, offers enhanced compensation and resettlement benefits, conducts effective propaganda to ensure resettlers fully understand the policies, and improves their living standards through infrastructure development, it results in a higher-level of trust in the local government among resettlers, which subsequently increases their willingness to participate voluntarily in expropriation and resettlement. Even though the local government could potentially save money by passively implementing policies when migrant participation is voluntary, it instead chooses to implement them actively. This approach positively contributes to social stability and economic development within the locality. Moreover, it enhances the trust of both resettlers and the community in the local government, leading to intangible benefits. Consequently, the local government becomes more inclined to implement policies and willingly participate in resettlement work actively. This inclination creates a positive feedback mechanism between the local government and resettlers, reinforcing and promoting each other. The evolutionary equilibrium solution \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\) reflects the mutual promotion between the two components. Specifically, the probability of the local government actively implementing policies and the probability of resettlers voluntarily participating converge towards \"1\" in the same direction.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the positive feedback mechanism within the system can also lead to a mutually reinforcing phenomenon. In other words, if the local government fails to adequately plan and prepare for requisition and relocation work, slows down the implementation of relevant compensation policies, it will result in delays in compensation for resettlers. As a result, they will be unable to reach the satisfaction level expected by resettlers who have taken on the risk of cooperating with the work. Inevitably, this will lead to protests among the passive migrants. This is a highly probable outcome during the implementation of numerous water conservancy projects involving requisition and relocation, and represents one of the significant reasons contributing to psychological resistance among resettlers. On the other hand, when resettlers are passively involved in the work, the local government considers the additional costs associated with suspending the work or selecting an alternative site. Additionally, there are expenses related to maintaining social stability through price increases. Consequently, the local government may opt to passively implement the policy to save funds. In this scenario, positive feedback exists between the local government and resettlers. The evolutionary equilibrium solution \\(E_{a} (0,0)\\) aligns with this situation, indicating that the probability of the local government positively implementing the policy and the likelihood of migrants voluntarily participating in the work both converge towards \"0\" in the same direction.",

        "summary": "The learning evolution mechanism was clarified using replication dynamic equations for local government and resettlers, their strategy choices, and perceived benefit functions. A system dynamics (SD) model was built using VENSIM PLE 10.2.2 software for the evolutionary game involving water conservancy project relocation stakeholders. Study data for numerical simulation modeling were obtained from the Qianping Reservoir resettlement case report. Initial parameter values for model auxiliary variables were set based on project data, literature, expert consultation, and scenario inequalities. Under Scenario 1 (initial willingness a=0.9, b=0.9), simulation showed both parties reached a stable state at E_a(0,0). Under Scenario 2 (initial willingness a=0.1, b=0.1), simulation showed both parties reached a stable state at E_d(1,1). The subsequent study continued with Scenario 1 parameter settings to analyze external variables' impact on strategy choices. The control variable method was employed to modify one subject's initial willingness probability to observe its impact on the other. When local government’s positive implementation inclination increased, resettlers' strategic choice took longer to reach an evolutionary steady state, resulting in a slower process, but both parties ultimately adopted a negative strategic choice. Adjusting resettlers' voluntary migration probability had minimal effect on the local government's strategic choices and created no distinction. The impact of modifying sensitive variables on strategy choices was examined using a=0.5, b=0.5 for both parties. Increased cost of local government's passive policy implementation (C3, C4) led the local government to favor active policy implementation, while having little impact on resettlers' choices. Increased due diligence reward (S2) for local government slowed passive implementation, with a shift to positive implementation; increased penalties (T2) similarly led the local government towards positive implementation. Decreased reference value of the payment account (U1) caused the local government to transition from passive to active policy implementation, and slowed resettlers' convergence towards involuntary migration without altering their choices. Decreased reference value of the gain account (U2) caused the local government to converge towards active implementation and resettlers to shift from involuntary to voluntary migration. Increased prices set by the local government (T3) in response to involuntary resettler participation led resettlers to converge faster towards a stable state under passive participation, with minimal effect on local government strategy. Increased additional risk (T4) borne by resettlers caused their strategic choice to shift from involuntary to voluntary migration. Increased additional synergistic gains (S4) led to more active implementation by the local government and more voluntary migration by resettlers. When the allocation ratio (ρ) increased (more gain for local government), the local government was more motivated to promote migration, but migrant voluntary participation was lower; conversely, when the ratio decreased (more gain for migrants), migrants were more willing, but local government showed lower implementation motivation. A mutually reinforcing positive feedback cycle emerged between the local government’s \"active implementation\" and resettlers’ \"voluntary participation,\" leading to an E_d(1,1) equilibrium where both probabilities converge to \"1.\" A mutually reinforcing negative feedback cycle emerged when the local government failed in planning/compensation, leading to resettler protests and the local government opting for passive implementation due to additional costs, resulting in an E_a(0,0) equilibrium where both probabilities converge to \"0.\""

        "content": "Plenty of studies, some of them published by the Arts Endowment, have shown how arts participation in early childhood appears to awaken greater social skills and behaviors at a crucial stage of development. It’s no surprise, especially among infants and toddlers, that most arts activities involve a parent or caregiver.\n\nIt stands to reason, therefore, that parents’ own preferences or backgrounds, their beliefs about the arts, and even their overall attitudes toward social engagement, might play a role in determining whether the parents involve their children in the arts, and—for that matter—whether their children experience positive outcomes associated with these activities.\n\nIn the peer-reviewed journal Infancy, a new article, titled “Parental Social and Musical Characteristics, the Home Music Environment, and Child Language Development in Infancy,” pursues these very questions. Authored by Ashley Boyne, Camila Alviar, and Miriam Lense—and supported in part by a NEA Research Lab award to Vanderbilt University Medical Center—the study tracks 43 caregiver/infant pairings (i.e., dyads) over a year and a half.\n\nThroughout this period, the researchers examined whether parents who enjoy other social activities were more likely than other parents to cultivate a “home music environment,” and whether they were more likely to sing and even more likely to report believing in the positive impacts of music for their children. By way of comparison, Boyne and colleagues also investigated whether parents’ levels of musical training predicted their home music environment, their likelihood of singing, and their beliefs about music.\n\nThe researchers then sought to understand whether this constellation of parental and household factors, in turn, predicted language development among infants. On this topic , the article cites an extensive body of literature, preeminently from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, showing how auditory processing of musical rhythms, and interpretation of audiovisual cues, can assist with language growth and expressive communication skills.\n\nAt various time points throughout the study, researchers administered a series of surveys to the parents/caregivers. The questionnaires separately gauged the home music environment of the parents (e.g., the degree of parent-child interaction around music-making, and the degree of the child’s active engagement with music), the parents’ extent of musical training, the parents’ beliefs about music (e.g., whether it “has an impact on [the] child’s intelligence”), and their self-reported levels of social competence. A separate inventory tool asked each parent to report, via checklist, how many and what types of words their infants spoke, words they understood, and gestures they made.\n\nAnalyses showed that social motivation was positively correlated with the home music environment—specifically, with parent beliefs in the power of music, and with parents singing to their infants. As for parents’ formal musical training, this variable was related solely to parents’ beliefs about music. It did not correlate with parent-child musical interactions. Thus, “parent social motivation was a stronger predictor of the home music environment than musical training,” the researchers write.\n\nBut what difference do parents’ musical habits and beliefs make in contributing to language development among infants? The study found that “the overall home music environment and specifically, parent singing, positively correlated with child language development across 9–18 months of age when considering multiple domains of language: vocabulary comprehension, vocabulary production, and gesture production,” the article states.\n\n“In contrast, we found no association between (parent-reported) parent beliefs and child language development,” the authors add.\n\nTo Boyne et al., the overall findings’ implications are plain. “Musical interactions provide a positive, highly social, and, in the case of singing, linguistically rich experience,” they write. “It is through these types of social interactive contexts that children learn and advance their communicative skills. The connection between parents' self-reported active singing behaviors with their infant and infant language and gesture development”—for example, in nursery rhyme singalongs—\"also highlights the embedded nature of infant learning, where children's skills are developed by interacting with their everyday environments.”\n\nFor all that, “it requires more than parents' belief in music for music to impact their child's development; parents must actively take steps to create this musical environment,” as the study demonstrates. “Enriching musical engagement with infants is likely more about the positive and interactive social experience rather than highly skilled musical experiences,” i.e., the parents’ level of musical training.\n\nIn other words, to quote Hamlet, the readiness is all. Parents who might give a second thought about their lack of musical training or experience: don’t hesitate! Sing to your babies. But then, if you consider yourself socially active, you probably are doing this already.\n\nSunil Iyengar directs the NEA Office of Research & Analysis.",

Harris, the current vice president, rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race amid alarm about his advanced age. Despite an initial surge of energy around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration.\n\nThe vice president has not publicly spoken since the race was called.

He is the first person convicted of a felony to be elected president and, at 78, is the oldest person elected to the office. His vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the U.S. government.\n\nCongratulations started pouring in from world leaders even before Trump’s victory was announced.\n\nThere will be far fewer checks on Trump when he returns to the White House. He has plans to swiftly enact a sweeping agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. His GOP critics in Congress have largely been defeated or retired. Federal courts are now filled with judges he appointed. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, issued a ruling earlier this year affording presidents broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nTrump’s language and behavior during the campaign sparked growing warnings from Democrats and some Republicans about shocks to democracy that his return to power would bring. He repeatedly praised strongman leaders, warned that he would deploy the military to target political opponents he labeled the “enemy from within,” threatened to take action against news organizations for unfavorable coverage and suggested suspending the Constitution.\n\nSERIES: A look at Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ campaign pledges\n\nSome who served in his first White House, including Vice President Mike Pence and John Kelly, Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, either declined to endorse him or issued dire public warnings about his return to the presidency.\n\nWhile Harris focused much of her initial message around themes of joy, Trump channeled a powerful sense of anger and resentment among voters\n\nHe seized on frustrations over high prices and fears about crime and migrants who illegally entered the country on Biden’s watch. He also highlighted wars in the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to cast Democrats as presiding over – and encouraging – a world in chaos.\n\nIt was a formula Trump perfected in 2016, when he cast himself as the only person who could fix the country’s problems, often borrowing language from dictators.\n\n“In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he said in March 2023.\n\nThis campaign often veered into the absurd, with Trump amplifying bizarre and disproven rumors that migrants were stealing and eating pet cats and dogs in an Ohio town. At one point, he kicked off a rally with a detailed story about the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer in which he praised his genitalia.\n\nREAD MORE: 24 things Trump is promising to do\n\nBut perhaps the defining moment came in July when a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump’s ear and killed one of his supporters. His face streaked with blood, Trump stood and raised his fist in the air, shouting “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Weeks later, a second assassination attempt was thwarted after a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through the greenery while Trump was playing golf.\n\nTrump is the first former president to return to power since Grover Cleveland regained the White House in the 1892 election.\n\nTrump’s return to the White House seemed unlikely when he left Washington in early 2021 as a diminished figure whose lies about his defeat sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was so isolated at the time that few outside of his family bothered to attend the send-off he organized for himself at Andrews Air Force Base, complete with a 21-gun salute.\n\nDemocrats who controlled the U.S. House quickly impeached him for his role in the insurrection, making him the only president to be impeached twice. He was acquitted by the U.S. Senate, where many Republicans argued that he no longer posed a threat because he had left office.\n\nBut from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump – aided by some elected Republicans – worked to maintain his political relevance. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who at the time led his party in the U.S. House, visited Trump soon after he left office, essentially validating his continued role in the party.\n\nAs the 2022 midterm election approached, Trump used the power of his endorsement to assert himself as the unquestioned leader of the party. His preferred candidates almost always won their primaries, but some went on to defeat in elections that Republicans viewed as within their grasp. Those disappointing results were driven in part by a backlash to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that revoked a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion, a decision that was aided by Trump-appointed justices. The midterm election prompted questions within the GOP about whether Trump should remain the party’s leader.\n\nBut if Trump’s future was in doubt, that changed in 2023 when he faced a wave of state and federal indictments for his role in the insurrection, his handling of classified information and election interference. He used the charges to portray himself as the victim of an overreaching government, an argument that resonated with a GOP base that was increasingly skeptical – if not outright hostile – to institutions and established power structures.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican nomination, lamented that the indictments “sucked out all the oxygen” from this year’s GOP primary. Trump easily captured his party’s nomination without ever participating in a debate against DeSantis or other GOP candidates.\n\nWhen he becomes president on Jan. 20, Trump could appoint an attorney general who would erase the federal charges.\n\nWith Trump dominating the Republican contest, a New York jury found him guilty in May of 34 felony charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. He faces sentencing later this month, though his victory poses serious questions about whether he will ever face punishment.\n\nHe has also been found liable in two other New York civil cases: one for inflating his assets and another for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996.\n\nTrump is subject to additional criminal charges in an election-interference case in Georgia that has become bogged down. On the federal level, he’s been indicted for his role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election and improperly handling classified material.

Additionally, \"the Biden administration very rarely touted their economic accomplishments, … their climate change accomplishments, … [and] their infrastructure and even border control and immigration [accomplishments],\" she said.\n\nTrump attracted new voters.\n\n\"One of the things [Trump] was able to do quite effectively was create a multiracial, multi-ethnic coalition of grievance populism that resulted in a powerful show at the polls,\" Mason said.\n\nTrump received more votes from Latino residents than any other Republican presidential candidate in history, and he also made notable inroads with Black voters. \"But in specific areas, particularly in battleground states, Trump doubled his percentage of support among Black male voters,\" Mason said.\n\nIn Dearborn, Michigan, which usually overwhelmingly back Democrats, as many as \"45% of Muslim residents voted for Donald Trump, 33% voted for Jill Stein, and support for Kamala Harris [dropped to an unprecedented] low 20s,\" said Wright Rigueur, who attributed the shift among Muslim voters to the Biden administration's handled the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nInformation inconsistencies contributed.\n\nHarris made women's reproductive rights a focal point of her campaign, but Trump didn't discuss the matter much, Mason said. When he did, he told audiences he wanted individual states to make the decision. It didn't help that \"a lot of the news sources Republicans tend to consume weren't saying anything about the threat to abortion access or rights,\" she said.\n\nWright Rigueur cited another example: the stimulus relief bill passed by Congress at the end of Trump's first presidency. Trump wanted to veto the bill \"but later had no choice but to sign it into law,\" she said. He then decided to put his name on the checks. \"Everybody laughed and [thought] it was arrogant, but people remember those checks and say, 'Donald Trump gave me $1,200.'\"\n\nWhat they don't remember, she continued, is the second round of $1,200 relief checks sent by Joe Biden. Why? Biden didn't print his name on the checks—he followed standard practice and had the Secretary of the Treasury sign them.\n\nResults reflect a global trend.\n\nIn elections worldwide, incumbent candidates are losing, and the Harris defeat is yet another example, Mason said.\n\n\"In response to inflation or to the trauma of COVID, the whole world is still trying to process fear and uncertainty,\" Mason explained. \"When [people] are uncertain, they tend to go toward a strongman\" or anti-establishment leader who isn't the incumbent.\n\nSimilarly, fear and uncertainty have fueled what some panelists called \"an anti-institution movement\"—that is, a growing distrust in the government agencies, universities, schools, and medical systems entrusted to take care of, educate, and advance society.\n\n\"Institutions have different rules than rogue actors or extremist groups,\" Mason said, \"and they're being scapegoated because they don't really fight back—they have to obey their own rules about inclusion and diversity and freedom of speech and pluralism.\"\n\nPolitical parties shifted.\n\nThe Republican base is now largely made up of the working class, panelists said.\n\n\"The Democratic coalition today is massively, disproportionately represented by professionals, university professors, experts, [and] all of those people who, to some degree, are the enforcers of propriety,\" Teles said.\n\nThe business community used to be an \"anchor tenant\" of the Republican Party, Teles added, and it remains to be seen whether \"Trump will just accept that a lot of business is going to leave the Republican Party, and that they'll pick up enough working-class party voters to be OK with business [primarily] ending up in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAccording to Dayton, \"if you are working in a high-skill information industry, [you're likely] going Democrat fast. If you're in an extractive industry [such as] agriculture and mining, you're going to have strong reasons to like Trump.\"\n\nTrump's style remains controversial.\n\nPanelists brought up concerns about Trump's unorthodox style on and off throughout the conversation. \"I'm of the firm belief that one of the reasons Trump did as well as he did, compared to 2020, is because he's not on TV every day,\" Scott said. \"If Trump continues being who he was, … I think people's tolerance for decency—or indecency, I should say—will be tested.\"\n\nNevertheless, many voters overlooked Trump's idiosyncrasies to cast a vote for him anyway.\n\n\"The reality is that too many voters are far less concerned about that than they are about their rent going up, the cost of X going up, higher education being incredibly unaffordable, and so many other issues affecting voters' day-to-day,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's agenda and power are still up in the air.\n\nJust because the Republican Party swept the Senate and is likely to narrowly control the House doesn't mean Trump will have unlimited power. As Scott said, \"the president has put forward an agenda and ideas, and he has said some things he'll do, but the reality is that he's not a king.\"\n\nDayton said much or some of what Trump campaigned on likely won't actually happen. The first Trump administration wanted to cut NSF funding, for example, but our \"Republican-led Congress gave [the funding] 20 to 30% increases every year.\"\n\n\"I have trouble seeing a world with massive cuts to science because we know that's a source of growth, and we've seen those budgets maintained across administrations,\" Dayton said. \"All of these people understand—and I put J.D. Vance at the top of this list—that research is a massive driver of economic growth and opportunity.\"\n\nScott said he knows many people are scared right now, including his students at Harvard, who expressed alarm after the election. \"I encourage people to not assume the worst will happen every single time,\" he said, adding that Trump tried to overturn the Affordable Care Act during his first administration, but it didn't happen.\n\n\"There is not a single president you can name who achieved everything he campaigned on, not just because of his political opponents but also because of people within their [own] party, and because the reality of making certain things happen is not as easy as giving a speech saying you're going to make something happen,\" Scott said.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office.",

        "ori_content": "Media Inquiries Name Johns Hopkins Media Relations Email jhunews@jhu.edu Office phone 443-997-9009\n\nDonald Trump winning a second White House term didn't come as a surprise to Johns Hopkins historian Leah Wright Rigueur, who homed in on the election's social-historical context:\n\n\"The increasing polarization over the last four years, [combined] with an incumbent president stepping down in the middle of his campaign and a Black, southeast Asian woman becoming the nominee for president and only having 107 days to prepare—Kamala Harris was running an uphill, underdog battle,\" said Wright Rigueur, an associate professor at the university's SNF Agora Institute.\n\nWright Rigueur joined panelists from both sides of the political divide on Nov. 7 to address the possible effects of the election during Johns Hopkins University's virtual event Insights and Impacts: Post-Election Debrief.\n\nVideo credit: Hopkins at Home and the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University\n\nAlongside Wright Rigueur, panelists included Soren Dayton, director of governance at the Niskanen Center, a non-partisan think tank; Lilliana Mason, associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins; and Eugene Scott, host of the political show Axios Live and a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School Institute of Politics.\n\nAmy Binder, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins, introduced the panelists, and Steven Teles, a Johns Hopkins political science professor and a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, moderated the Hopkins at Home event, which was free and open to the public.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from the conversation:\n\nEconomic worries mattered.\n\n\"We currently have the best economy in the world within the United States, … but there was a real disconnect between how the economy works in theory and on paper [and] how people were feeling it in their day-to-day lives,\" Wright Rigueur said.\n\nHarris spoke about increasing wages and making home-buying more affordable, but her message didn't break through, Wright Rigueur said. Additionally, \"the Biden administration very rarely touted their economic accomplishments, … their climate change accomplishments, … [and] their infrastructure and even border control and immigration [accomplishments],\" she said.\n\nTrump attracted new voters.\n\n\"One of the things [Trump] was able to do quite effectively was create a multiracial, multi-ethnic coalition of grievance populism that resulted in a powerful show at the polls,\" Mason said.\n\nTrump received more votes from Latino residents than any other Republican presidential candidate in history, and he also made notable inroads with Black voters. \"But in specific areas, particularly in battleground states, Trump doubled his percentage of support among Black male voters,\" Mason said.\n\nIn Dearborn, Michigan, which usually overwhelmingly back Democrats, as many as \"45% of Muslim residents voted for Donald Trump, 33% voted for Jill Stein, and support for Kamala Harris [dropped to an unprecedented] low 20s,\" said Wright Rigueur, who attributed the shift among Muslim voters to the Biden administration's handled the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nInformation inconsistencies contributed.\n\nHarris made women's reproductive rights a focal point of her campaign, but Trump didn't discuss the matter much, Mason said. When he did, he told audiences he wanted individual states to make the decision. It didn't help that \"a lot of the news sources Republicans tend to consume weren't saying anything about the threat to abortion access or rights,\" she said.\n\nWright Rigueur cited another example: the stimulus relief bill passed by Congress at the end of Trump's first presidency. Trump wanted to veto the bill \"but later had no choice but to sign it into law,\" she said. He then decided to put his name on the checks. \"Everybody laughed and [thought] it was arrogant, but people remember those checks and say, 'Donald Trump gave me $1,200.'\"\n\nWhat they don't remember, she continued, is the second round of $1,200 relief checks sent by Joe Biden. Why? Biden didn't print his name on the checks—he followed standard practice and had the Secretary of the Treasury sign them.\n\nResults reflect a global trend.\n\nIn elections worldwide, incumbent candidates are losing, and the Harris defeat is yet another example, Mason said.\n\n\"In response to inflation or to the trauma of COVID, the whole world is still trying to process fear and uncertainty,\" Mason explained. \"When [people] are uncertain, they tend to go toward a strongman\" or anti-establishment leader who isn't the incumbent.\n\nSimilarly, fear and uncertainty have fueled what some panelists called \"an anti-institution movement\"—that is, a growing distrust in the government agencies, universities, schools, and medical systems entrusted to take care of, educate, and advance society.\n\n\"Institutions have different rules than rogue actors or extremist groups,\" Mason said, \"and they're being scapegoated because they don't really fight back—they have to obey their own rules about inclusion and diversity and freedom of speech and pluralism.\"\n\nPolitical parties shifted.\n\nThe Republican base is now largely made up of the working class, panelists said.\n\n\"The Democratic coalition today is massively, disproportionately represented by professionals, university professors, experts, [and] all of those people who, to some degree, are the enforcers of propriety,\" Teles said.\n\nThe business community used to be an \"anchor tenant\" of the Republican Party, Teles added, and it remains to be seen whether \"Trump will just accept that a lot of business is going to leave the Republican Party, and that they'll pick up enough working-class party voters to be OK with business [primarily] ending up in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAccording to Dayton, \"if you are working in a high-skill information industry, [you're likely] going Democrat fast. If you're in an extractive industry [such as] agriculture and mining, you're going to have strong reasons to like Trump.\"\n\nTrump's style remains controversial.\n\nPanelists brought up concerns about Trump's unorthodox style on and off throughout the conversation. \"I'm of the firm belief that one of the reasons Trump did as well as he did, compared to 2020, is because he's not on TV every day,\" Scott said. \"If Trump continues being who he was, … I think people's tolerance for decency—or indecency, I should say—will be tested.\"\n\nNevertheless, many voters overlooked Trump's idiosyncrasies to cast a vote for him anyway.\n\n\"The reality is that too many voters are far less concerned about that than they are about their rent going up, the cost of X going up, higher education being incredibly unaffordable, and so many other issues affecting voters' day-to-day,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's agenda and power are still up in the air.\n\nJust because the Republican Party swept the Senate and is likely to narrowly control the House doesn't mean Trump will have unlimited power. As Scott said, \"the president has put forward an agenda and ideas, and he has said some things he'll do, but the reality is that he's not a king.\"\n\nDayton said much or some of what Trump campaigned on likely won't actually happen. The first Trump administration wanted to cut NSF funding, for example, but our \"Republican-led Congress gave [the funding] 20 to 30% increases every year.\"\n\n\"I have trouble seeing a world with massive cuts to science because we know that's a source of growth, and we've seen those budgets maintained across administrations,\" Dayton said. \"All of these people understand—and I put J.D. Vance at the top of this list—that research is a massive driver of economic growth and opportunity.\"\n\nScott said he knows many people are scared right now, including his students at Harvard, who expressed alarm after the election. \"I encourage people to not assume the worst will happen every single time,\" he said, adding that Trump tried to overturn the Affordable Care Act during his first administration, but it didn't happen.\n\n\"There is not a single president you can name who achieved everything he campaigned on, not just because of his political opponents but also because of people within their [own] party, and because the reality of making certain things happen is not as easy as giving a speech saying you're going to make something happen,\" Scott said.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office."

After polling for weeks had shown a too-close-to-call race that might take days to conclude, Trump’s clear win struck many as a shock.\n\nAnalysts will likely need years to fully understand the forces that drove his return to power. But on the day after, top UC Berkeley scholars offer a sharp and sometimes unsettling assessment of the dynamics at play. Some cite Trump’s appeal to white voters, who looked past the insurrection against democracy on Jan. 6, 2021. One says that Americans are not ready to trust a woman with presidential power. And others say Trump’s victory reflects a global rage against political leadership and warn that it could help fuel a new era of global instability.\n\nBelow, read a full range of responses to the election results by UC Berkeley experts in political science, sociology, international relations and other fields.\n\nWhat is your main takeaway from the election results that will bring Donald Trump back to the White House?\n\nEric Schickler\n\nThere are many takeaways from the election results. But the most important implication is that just four years after the Jan. 6 insurrection, former President Trump will be back in the White House — now surrounded by staff and agency leaders who will be more committed to him both personally and to his agenda.\n\nWith a Republican Senate (and likely House), he will be able to make some major legislative changes, especially when it comes to taxes. But as head of the executive branch, he will be in a position to act unilaterally on a host of other issues, pushing the limits of presidential power. With a supportive Supreme Court, the implications for policy and governance are hard to overstate.\n\n— Eric Schickler, political scientist and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS)\n\nYou’ve spoken about how economic insecurity led white men, in particular, to support Trump and stick with him. What does his defeat of Kamala Harris tell you about the enduring power of that demographic’s political beliefs and power?\n\nI see the outcome of the presidential election fundamentally as an expression of anger about the state of the economy. As the saying goes, “It is the economy, stupid.” The economy is working well for some groups of people, to be sure, but there are different economies for different sets of people.\n\nRaka Ray\n\nBut it’s also not just “the economy, stupid.” I would never discount the racist and misogynist rejection of a Black and South Asian woman; the deliberately circulated fears and lies that fed the wounded racial and masculine identity of particular demographic groups; the willingness of some immigrants to shut the door behind them; and the bogey figure of “trans” that came to stand in for historic changes that were hard to grapple with. Neither would I discount the effect of the global conflicts in which America is implicated.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I do not believe that these results would have occurred if large populations of Americans did not worry about the cost of groceries, utilities and rents. The success of a political party depends on its responsiveness to its constituents — not just as a pool of votes, but also to the social and political movements through which they express themselves. There are lessons here that the Democratic Party has, unfortunately, consistently failed to heed.\n\n— Raka Ray, dean of UC Berkeley Social Sciences and professor of sociology and South Asian studies\n\nBefore the election, a Berkeley IGS Poll found that even in California, support for Kamala Harris was significantly less than Joe Biden’s 2020 support among Asian American and Latinx voters, and particularly men in those communities. An exit poll this morning showed that Latinx men really moved toward Trump. Do you have any insights as to why so many in these communities turned from Harris or were drawn to Trump?\n\nThere has been much discussion this election about growing support for Trump among non-white voters, but little focus on the ongoing and growing support for Trump among white voters, particularly white women. Many pundits assumed white women would turn out for Harris because of their concerns about reproductive justice. Yet, we must remember that white women have only voted Democratic once in the past 50 years: That was in 1996, in favor of Bill Clinton.\n\nLisa García Bedolla\n\nLooking at voters of color, although it is true that Latine men seemed to be more supportive of Trump this cycle, I would be very skeptical of exit poll results that are significantly different from high-quality survey results taken shortly before the election. Exit polls have many methodological problems and are particularly bad at identifying trends within ethno-racial subpopulations. In October, Latine polling by Equis Research found about 55% Latine support for Harris in the battleground states, with stronger support among Latina women. There is no reason to believe things looked significantly different on Election Day.\n\nA more useful question is to consider the reasons underlying Trump’s appeal to voters. Many pundits have questioned how voters could support Trump in spite of his racist and misogynist statements. I would argue that many voters supported him because of these assertions. It was not only that many saw those controversial words as proof of his willingness to speak the “truth.” For some voters, Trump’s words made them feel powerful, gave them someone to blame for their problems, and made them feel confident he could fix them.\n\n— Lisa García Bedolla, political scientist, vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division\n\nDemocrats have nominated women as their presidential candidates twice in the past eight years, and both have lost. To what extent do you think gender played a role in the outcome, especially this year?\n\nAmong the many sociocultural factors affecting presidential elections, gender has been a defining dynamic for the last three cycles, with voters facing choices between male and female candidates for both presidential and vice presidential positions. The gender dynamics of the most recent election were intensified by contentious debates over reproductive rights and their disproportionate impact on women, as well as by one candidate’s explicit embrace of hypermasculinity.\n\nLaura Kray\n\nTwo fundamental questions emerged: whether voters would choose between dominant versus prestigious leadership styles, and whether America was ready to advance toward greater gender equality by electing a woman to the world’s most powerful position. The results appear to confirm that most American voters still implicitly endorse traditional gender hierarchies in political leadership, maintaining a system where men hold predominant power and authority.\n\nThe voting patterns across these recent elections reflect deeper societal dynamics around gender and power, suggesting that our society remains more comfortable with women in supporting roles rather than as the primary decision-maker, metaphorically preferring men at the helm while women occupy the passenger seat. While Americans may support women’s advancement in principle, electoral behavior continues to reflect weak implicit (and explicit) associations between the concepts of women and power.\n\n— Laura Kray, psychologist and director of the Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership at the Haas School of Business\n\nWhy is hate and fear-mongering so motivating? Why did the GOP choose to capitalize on anti-trans hate in this election?\n\nThroughout their presidential campaign, the Republican Party used — which is to say produced — an atmosphere of anti-trans hate to move people to the polls, and it seems to have worked. For years, a coalition which includes many self-identified conservatives, along with their liberal co-conspirators, have seeded a trans panic on the local level, whether at school boards, libraries, sports fields and medical facilities.\n\nEric A. Stanley\n\nAs I’ve argued in my most recent book, anti-trans hate is so wildly successful because it makes the public fearfully obsessed with trans people. Ironically, many conservative commentators spend more hours per day talking about gender than I do as a professor who studies it. Of course, much of what they say is factually incorrect. However, they own the means of distribution, and so it is received as truth.\n\nThat said, anti-trans antagonism is a bipartisan affair. While the Republicans have been loud and clear about their will to eradicate trans people, Democrats have remained mostly silent. One could speculate that they fear the vitriol many of us survive, or perhaps they passively agree. Either way, it is illustrative of the Democratic Party’s move further toward the right which helped them lose the election.\n\n— Eric A. Stanley, Haas Distinguished Chair in LGBT Equity\n\nWas there a flaw, or a failure, in the Democrats’ strategy or tactics in this election that contributed to Trump’s win and Harris’ defeat?\n\nHarris launched strong, but after her great performance in the Sept. 10 debate, she and her party reverted to their ultra-risk-averse, low-dominance ways.\n\nM. Steven Fish\n\nHarris largely dropped the hard-edged, provocative spirit of her DNC speech and the debate. In interviews, she offered evasive, scripted, chutzpah-free answers, creating the impression that she was just a typical politician. Instead of staying on offense and limiting their attention to Trump largely to ridiculing him, the Democrats fell back on their timeworn, futile tactic of ceding the spotlight to him, repeating his outrageous statements and enjoining everyone to be fearful and offended.\n\nRather than forcefully celebrating the roaring economy, Harris remained wedded to the 21st century Democrats’ delusion that you score more points — even when the economy is sizzling and you’re in power — by expressing sympathy for supposedly suffering voters. Harris could have honored Americans’ bootstrap mentality and leveraged their patriotism, casting her program as a pro-growth dynamo that would send wages and corporate profits soaring and ensure that the American economy continues to leave the rest of the world in the dust.\n\nInstead, she played Santa Claus: a $50,000 tax credit for first-time business starters, $25,000 for first-time homebuyers, a $6,000 credit for newborns.\n\nHarris is a strong leader and a diehard patriot, and Trump is a coward at heart and a traitor to boot. Tragically, the Democrats neglected to show it.\n\n— M. Steven Fish, political scientist, author of “Comeback: Routing Trumpism, Reclaiming the Nation, and Restoring Democracy’s Edge”\n\nThe reflexive, morning-after worry is that U.S. democracy will literally and directly be at risk in a second Trump term. Is that a valid concern?\n\nDemocratic institutions in the U.S. continue to be under strain. It is a challenge for any country to have a national executive who has attempted to subvert a previous election.\n\nJake Grumbach\n\nOne concern is that the executive branch will use its authority to influence the administration of the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential elections. A second concern is that the reelection of a politician who has attempted election subversion will incentivize and embolden other politicians to threaten the rule of law and peaceful transfer of power. A third concern is that the “stop the steal” conspiracy about the 2020 election will continue to be popular, leading to further distrust in U.S. election administration.\n\nThis election has made clear that a majority of Americans are willing to vote for a candidate who threatens the rule of law, a serious concern of the Founders.\n\n— Jacob Grumbach, political scientist, leader of the Democracy Policy Lab at the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nTo what extent do you feel conspiracy theories or conspiratorial thinking shaped the outcome of this election? Why does conspiracy thinking have such power over much of the electorate?\n\nThe United States has always been a nation of conspiracy theorists, and once again we will have a conspiracy theorist-in-chief. American politics have long been shaped by fears of conspiracy, from the colonial-era Illuminati to Henry Ford’s antisemitism. In 1965, historian Richard Hofstadter critiqued the “paranoid style” of demagogues and populists on the (mostly right-wing) fringe as the price society paid for consensus at the “vital center.”\n\nMichael Mark Cohen\n\nBut in the post-9/11 era, these fringes have conquered whatever remained of liberal society. Trump began his political rise with the “birther” conspiracy. His Muslim ban and border wall were not just nativist slogans, but solutions to the perceived threat of infiltrators seeking to “replace” white voters. And there was the “big lie” of 2020, in which massive voter fraud (now magically vanquished) prevented his re-election.\n\nThis new administration will be staffed with conspiracy theorists like Stephen Miller and RFK Jr., who promise to deliver Trump’s vengeance. Within the grip of paranoia, every accusation is both projection and a confession, and those who imagine themselves victims of conspiracy tend to conspire against others. But now, instead of this being a fringe fantasy, Trump’s authoritarian, if not openly fascist, conspiracy theories will be backed by the might of the American Empire.\n\n— Michael Mark Cohen, associate teaching professor of American studies and African American studies\n\nPut Trump’s victory in an international context: In tone and substance, does it parallel upheavals happening in other parts of the world?\n\nDonald Trump’s election fits a pattern of populist-nationalist insurgencies that have roiled democracies in the decade since Britain’s choice for Brexit. Populist-nationalists, as I would call them, have won elections in Europe, Latin America and South and Southeast Asia. Their insurgencies reflect impatience with incumbents and prevailing policies, but not with democracy itself. Democracy encompasses many varieties of politics, after all, and what we see in this populist-nationalist groundswell is a majoritarian reaction against the liberal-democratic synthesis that achieved broad global influence in the late 20th century.\n\nDaniel Sargent\n\nPut in broader perspective, the efforts of populists like Trump to “take back control,” reestablish borders and draw hard lines between insiders and outsiders aren’t novel; they’re doing what nationalists do. Liberals (like me) lament the populist-nationalist phenomenon, but we should hope — now that Trump has won — that populist-nationalism brings some benefits, especially for those Americans who have borne the brunt of globalization’s downside.\n\nMy deeper worry is for world order: Liberal policies and commitments sustained a tolerable peace and bolstered global prosperity over the past half-century. If history is any guide, the rise of populist-nationalism risks escalating international strife.\n\n— Daniel J. Sargent, historian and co-director of the Institute of International Studies\n\nGlobally, incumbents have recently experienced voters’ anger — it’s not just a U.S. phenomenon. In some cases, this seems to reflect an impatience with democracy itself. How would you explain this global pattern? Are there conditions or characteristics common across countries?\n\nSusan Hyde\n\nIt will take some time before we know exactly whether this election is similar to other countries’ experiences. Populism, frustration with inflation, ethnonationalism, and politician-led manipulation of voter fears about their fellow citizens are common to many elections around the world in recent years.\n\nIs this why Trump won? They are all potentially contributing factors, but I would hesitate before concluding that impatience with democracy itself is a global trend.\n\nRather, I see the global trend as one in which some of the institutional support structures for democratic processes — a strong and independent media at local and national levels, strong political parties, the massive increases in disinformation without any effective counter to it — weaken and make it easier for both populist and nativist politicians to thrive.\n\n— Susan D. Hyde, political scientist and co-director of the Institute of International Studies\n\nWhat did you learn from the election? And what does the future hold?\n\nThis presidential campaign illuminated the tensions between the ideals of American democracy and the human motives that can get in its way.\n\nDavid C. Wilson\n\nFormer President Trump and current Vice President Harris provided clear contrasts in experience, capacity, enthusiasm, optimism and compassion. While Harris provided policy details and offered bipartisan appeals, Trump cast a dark picture of criminal immigration, demonization and a country in decline. To the amazement of many, this appeal worked. One can only conclude that, for a majority of Americans, democracy is less about people and more about power — and who ought to hold it.\n\nA few points from exit polling stand out. While Harris won the women’s vote overall, white women, especially those who are suburban, married or who have no college degree, favored Trump. And while she won voters of color overall, Native Americans and Latino men favored Trump. The implication is that a majority of Americans may still have concerns about a president being a woman, person of color, or both.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the presidential election was but one contest on a ballot of many decisions for voters. While former President Trump won a majority and the Electoral College, Democrats won statewide offices in the challenging states of Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nArizona’s constitutional right to abortion amendment passed overwhelmingly, as did Alaska’s minimum wage increase and sick leave requirement. The 2024 elections also yielded new African American female senators from Delaware and Maryland, and the first transgender representative and LGBTQ+ representative from the South. The point is that the election revealed the dynamism and range of American democracy, but also the continuing racial and gender criteria that inform how people decide their leadership.\n\n— David C. Wilson, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nKara Manke and Anne Brice contributed to this report.",

Raka Ray But it ’ s also not just “ the economy , stupid. ” I would never discount the racist and misogynist rejection of a Black and South Asian woman ; the deliberately circulated fears and lies that fed the wounded racial and masculine identity of particular demographic groups ; the willingness of some immigrants to shut the door behind them ; and the bogey figure of “ trans ” that came to stand in for historic changes that were hard to grapple with . Neither would I discount the effect of the global conflicts in which America is implicated . But at the end of the day , I do not believe that these results would have occurred if large populations of Americans did not worry about the cost of groceries , utilities and rents . The success of a political party depends on its responsiveness to its constituents — not just as a pool of votes , but also to the social and political movements through which they express themselves . There are lessons here that the Democratic Party has , unfortunately , consistently failed to heed . — Raka Ray , dean of UC Berkeley Social Sciences and professor of sociology and South Asian studies Before the election , a Berkeley IGS Poll found that even in California , support for Kamala Harris was significantly less than Joe Biden ’ s 2020 support among Asian American and Latinx voters , and particularly men in those communities . An exit poll this morning showed that Latinx men really moved toward Trump . Do you have any insights as to why so many in these communities turned from Harris or were drawn to Trump ? There has been much discussion this election about growing support for Trump among non-white voters , but little focus on the ongoing and growing support for Trump among white voters , particularly white women . Many pundits assumed white women would turn out for Harris because of their concerns about reproductive justice . Yet , we must remember that white women have only voted Democratic once in the past 50 years : That was in 1996 , in favor of Bill Clinton . Lisa García Bedolla Looking at voters of color , although it is true that Latine men seemed to be more supportive of Trump this cycle , I would be very skeptical of exit poll results that are significantly different from high-quality survey results taken shortly before the election . Exit polls have many methodological problems and are particularly bad at identifying trends within ethno-racial subpopulations . In October , Latine polling by Equis Research found about 55 % Latine support for Harris in the battleground states , with stronger support among Latina women . There is no reason to believe things looked significantly different on Election Day . A more useful question is to consider the reasons underlying Trump ’ s appeal to voters . Many pundits have questioned how voters could support Trump in spite of his racist and misogynist statements . I would argue that many voters supported him because of these assertions . It was not only that many saw those controversial words as proof of his willingness to speak the “ truth. ” For some voters , Trump ’ s words made them feel powerful , gave them someone to blame for their problems , and made them feel confident he could fix them . — Lisa García Bedolla , political scientist , vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division Democrats have nominated women as their presidential candidates twice in the past eight years , and both have lost . To what extent do you think gender played a role in the outcome , especially this year ? Among the many sociocultural factors affecting presidential elections , gender has been a defining dynamic for the last three cycles , with voters facing choices between male and female candidates for both presidential and vice presidential positions . The gender dynamics of the most recent election were intensified by contentious debates over reproductive rights and their disproportionate impact on women , as well as by one candidate ’ s explicit embrace of hypermasculinity . Laura Kray Two fundamental questions emerged : whether voters would choose between dominant versus prestigious leadership styles , and whether America was ready to advance toward greater gender equality by electing a woman to the world ’ s most powerful position . The results appear to confirm that most American voters still implicitly endorse traditional gender hierarchies in political leadership , maintaining a system where men hold predominant power and authority . The voting patterns across these recent elections reflect deeper societal dynamics around gender and power , suggesting that our society remains more comfortable with women in supporting roles rather than as the primary decision-maker , metaphorically preferring men at the helm while women occupy the passenger seat . While Americans may support women ’ s advancement in principle , electoral behavior continues to reflect weak implicit ( and explicit ) associations between the concepts of women and power . — Laura Kray , psychologist and director of the Center for Equity , Gender , and Leadership at the Haas School of Business Why is hate and fear-mongering so motivating ? Why did the GOP choose to capitalize on anti-trans hate in this election ? Throughout their presidential campaign , the Republican Party used — which is to say produced — an atmosphere of anti-trans hate to move people to the polls , and it seems to have worked . For years , a coalition which includes many self-identified conservatives , along with their liberal co-conspirators , have seeded a trans panic on the local level , whether at school boards , libraries , sports fields and medical facilities . Eric A. Stanley As I ’ ve argued in my most recent book , anti-trans hate is so wildly successful because it makes the public fearfully obsessed with trans people . Ironically , many conservative commentators spend more hours per day talking about gender than I do as a professor who studies it . Of course , much of what they say is factually incorrect . However , they own the means of distribution , and so it is received as truth . That said , anti-trans antagonism is a bipartisan affair . While the Republicans have been loud and clear about their will to eradicate trans people , Democrats have remained mostly silent . One could speculate that they fear the vitriol many of us survive , or perhaps they passively agree . Either way , it is illustrative of the Democratic Party ’ s move further toward the right which helped them lose the election . — Eric A. Stanley , Haas Distinguished Chair in LGBT Equity Was there a flaw , or a failure , in the Democrats ’ strategy or tactics in this election that contributed to Trump ’ s win and Harris ’ defeat ? Harris launched strong , but after her great performance in the Sept. 10 debate , she and her party reverted to their ultra-risk-averse , low-dominance ways . M. Steven Fish Harris largely dropped the hard-edged , provocative spirit of her DNC speech and the debate . In interviews , she offered evasive , scripted , chutzpah-free answers , creating the impression that she was just a typical politician . Instead of staying on offense and limiting their attention to Trump largely to ridiculing him , the Democrats fell back on their timeworn , futile tactic of ceding the spotlight to him , repeating his outrageous statements and enjoining everyone to be fearful and offended . Rather than forcefully celebrating the roaring economy , Harris remained wedded to the 21st century Democrats ’ delusion that you score more points — even when the economy is sizzling and you ’ re in power — by expressing sympathy for supposedly suffering voters . Harris could have honored Americans ’ bootstrap mentality and leveraged their patriotism , casting her program as a pro-growth dynamo that would send wages and corporate profits soaring and ensure that the American economy continues to leave the rest of the world in the dust . Instead , she played Santa Claus : a $ 50,000 tax credit for first-time business starters , $ 25,000 for first-time homebuyers , a $ 6,000 credit for newborns . Harris is a strong leader and a diehard patriot , and Trump is a coward at heart and a traitor to boot . Tragically , the Democrats neglected to show it . — M. Steven Fish , political scientist , author of “ Comeback : Routing Trumpism , Reclaiming the Nation , and Restoring Democracy ’ s Edge ” The reflexive , morning-after worry is that U.S. democracy will literally and directly be at risk in a second Trump term . Is that a valid concern ? Democratic institutions in the U.S. continue to be under strain . It is a challenge for any country to have a national executive who"

FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour. (Laughs.) KISSANE: Thank you.

        "ori_content": "Oil and Petroleum Products Carolyn Kissane , academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University , leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil . FASKIANOS : Thank you . Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series . I ’ m Irina Faskianos , vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR . Today ’ s discussion is on the record . And the video and transcript will be available on our website , CFR.org/Academic , if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates . As always , CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy . We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil . Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU ’ s Center for Global Affairs , where she is also a clinical professor . She also serves as director of the energy , climate justice , and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU . She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy , and top ten energy communicator . She ’ s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations , and serves on several boards . So , Carolyn , thanks very much for doing this . We really appreciate it . I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed , especially vis-à-vis Russia ’ s war in Ukraine and OPEC ’ s recent announcement to cut oil production ? KISSANE : Well , first of all , I ’ d just like to say , thank you so very much for having me . I ’ m really delighted . I am a big fan of CFR ’ s Academic Webinars . So , to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me . So , thank you . So , wow . There is so much happening in this space , the geopolitics of oil . This has been a tremendous fourteen months . Russia ’ s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer , one of the top three in the world . And it ’ s—you know , it ’ s caused a kind of a reshaping , a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics . And we ’ ve seen some , you know , shifts in how countries think about oil security , in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions . And also , on top of that , is the ongoing energy transition , coupled with , you know , climate change , and the need to decarbonize . So , there ’ s just—it ’ s been quite a—you know , a year and a half , that has really sort of put energy security , and oil security , very much at the forefront of people ’ s minds . FASKIANOS : Fantastic . I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us . And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life , that would be fantastic . KISSANE : Sure . So , before I do—I have a couple of slides . And before I share my slides , I think it ’ s really important that , sort of , we understand how interconnected , sort of , the global energy system is , and how interconnected we are , when it comes to the flows of oil . You know , some countries are very well resourced-endowed , so they have oil . And other countries do not , so they need to import oil . There ’ s really no country in the world that doesn ’ t need oil for larger national security issues . And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about , is the amount of oil that gets produced every day . So , every day , the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day . And every day , that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved . It has to be—you know , as part of getting it into the system , getting it to its respective destinations . And what we ’ re not seeing—which , maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we ’ re not seeing a reduction in demand , but we ’ re seeing an expansion in demand . And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia . And we ’ re also , of course , seeing the—with the reopening of China , lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years , whether or not they will—they will , sort of , put extra pressure on global demand . And you know , Irina , just also , you know , it ’ s—I ’ m going to share this in my slides . But you know , last week ’ s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production , of course , had an impact on the price of oil . So when the decision was announced on Sunday , by Monday morning , we saw an uptick in the price . It ’ s stabilized , but we are sort of looking at $ 80-plus-a-barrel oil . And again , lots of uncertainty as to what that ’ s going to mean across economies that are in recessions , experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession , and sort of what does it mean for the global economy , where we may see sort of more energy inflation . So , one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals . Because I think , again , sort of , really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system , but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced , and where in the world are the—are the importers . And also , just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen , just this—you know , in the last week , of course , some of this—you ’ ll be familiar with , those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again , happening at a time , not when we have an excess supply , but when we ’ re seeing a tight supply across the oil market . So , it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most , you know , longstanding analysts and OPEC observers . And again , part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts . But of course , it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States . What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump ? So , the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed , surprised that OPEC would make this decision . Now , it ’ s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision . This is part of , now , a larger OPEC+ . And OPEC+ does also include Russia , as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico . So , the OPEC that we have historically known is now different , because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+ . And these are the countries that are part of OPEC , and really the country that ’ s considered to be sort of in the driver ’ s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia , because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization , producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day . Venezuela has the largest reserves , but it is far from being at capacity , in terms of what it can—what it can produce . So , just to kind of put that into perspective , these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves . And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country , but again , this sort of—this chart to the right shows , you know , again , the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day , expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 , question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand . But again , to sort of link this to energy security—energy security , especially when it ’ s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices . So , when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets , that suggests that we ’ re also going to see higher prices that ’ s going to directly hit vulnerable economies . And so , again , just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers : the United States , Saudi Arabia , and Russia . Russia remains in the top three . Canada as well , our , you know , neighbor to the north . And China is also a producer of oil . The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied , so liquid petroleum , which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas . And then the top oil consuming countries , you have U.S. , China , and India . Now , the United States is not the largest importer . That position is now held by China . But as far as consumption goes , we consume over 20 million barrels a day . Again , big question mark about China , in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year , two years , with China ’ s reopening and what is being , you know , discussed as revenge tourism . And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings , 2.1 trillion , how are they going to use that savings and whether or not , after three years of being under lockdown restrictions , whether or not we ’ ll see impacts to demand . And I think Russia is—there ’ s lots of questions about Russia . And this is now—we ’ re fourteen months into , you know , Russia ’ s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion , because oftentimes , we forget that , you know , Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 . But Russia is still moving its oil . And up until , you know , a few months ago , its overall production and exports were as high—at some points , even higher—than pre-invasion . Now , you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil , and they ’ re buying it at discounted prices . We see Turkey , Singapore , China has been a big buyer ,"

        "content": "President Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office on Friday after Mr. Musk announced his departure from his role as a special government employee.\n\nElon Musk lashed out on Tuesday against the far-reaching Republican bill intended to enact President Trump’s domestic policy agenda, posting on X that it was a “disgusting abomination” and telling House members who voted for it: “You know you did wrong.”\n\nThe tech billionaire criticized the bill, one of Mr. Trump’s top priorities, in a series of about 10 posts. In them, Mr. Musk reshared commentary from lawmakers like Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, two Republicans who had sided with him in opposing the rising U.S. deficit.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Mr. Musk wrote on X. He called the domestic policy bill “massive, outrageous, pork-filled,” adding that it would “massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit” and that “Congress is making America bankrupt.”\n\nHe did not target any specific members of Congress, but hinted that he might support efforts to unseat those who backed the bill in the 2026 midterm elections. “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote.\n\nThe blitz of messages signaled a widening rift between Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump as the tech mogul winds down his governmental role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. While the men have publicly professed continued admiration for each other, Mr. Musk’s departure from Washington has appeared to liberate him from presenting a united front with the White House.\n\nInstead, he has returned to wielding his brand of unpredictable political influence through X, the social media platform he owns. In December, before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Musk torpedoed a bipartisan spending bill with an onslaught of posts on X, including a threat to find primary challengers for Republicans who supported it. In March, he tried unsuccessfully to sway the outcome of a Wisconsin judicial race with myriad posts in favor of the conservative candidate.\n\nNow unshackled from loyalty to the Trump party line, Mr. Musk can again foment chaos with his X feed.\n\nMr. Musk, 53, has often criticized legislation, agencies and others that are against the interests of himself and his companies, which include the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. In its current form, Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill would end subsidies and tax credits meant to spur consumers to buy electric vehicles, which would have ramifications for Tesla.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, called Mr. Musk’s criticism of the domestic policy bill “very disappointing.” He told reporters at the Capitol that the two spoke on Monday and that Mr. Musk “seemed to understand” the virtues of the legislation.\n\nThe White House and the president were caught off guard by Mr. Musk’s posts, a person with knowledge of the situation said, but it’s not yet clear whether Mr. Trump will return fire.\n\n“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”\n\nA representative for Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Trump has urged swift passage of the legislation — officially called the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — which would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement. As written, the legislation would cut health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.\n\nWhite House officials and Mr. Johnson have claimed that the bill would shrink the national debt, although the Congressional Budget Office and a number of independent analysts have estimated that the bill would increase federal deficits by well over $1 trillion, even when economic growth is factored in.\n\nMr. Musk posted his criticism at a critical moment for the bill, which passed the House on May 22 in the face of a strong pressure campaign by Mr. Trump. As Mr. Johnson corralled several competing Republican factions, the president summoned recalcitrant holdouts to the White House, and his staff likened Republican opposition to the bill to “the ultimate betrayal.”\n\nBut Republican senators have already made clear that they plan to make changes to the bill. Fiscal conservatives, alarmed at the estimates that it would swell the national debt, have demanded further changes and cuts to Medicaid and other programs that could help rein in deficits. Mr. Trump has warned Republicans not to mess with Medicaid, a program that many of his supporters rely on.\n\nMr. Musk started publicly criticizing Mr. Trump’s bill last week, saying on CBS News’s “Sunday Morning” that he was disappointed in the legislation’s size and impact on the deficit.\n\nPeople close to the congressional negotiations said Mr. Musk was disappointed that Republicans were removing electric vehicle subsidies, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.\n\n“I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that,” Mr. Johnson said. But he added that he did not believe the government should be subsidizing a transition to electric cars.\n\nIn an earlier public break with the administration, Mr. Musk slammed the president’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, as a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a series of X posts in April. Tesla executives said Mr. Musk, who abstained from criticizing Mr. Trump directly, seemed not to immediately realize the impact that the administration’s tariffs could have on the automaker.\n\nThe White House downplayed the conflict at the time. Asked about it then, Ms. Leavitt said, “Boys will be boys.” Late that month, Mr. Musk was briefed on the tariffs’ effects and the company’s supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nMr. Musk’s threats about unseating Republicans contrast with his political spending last year. His super PAC, America PAC, spent about $20 million in the last election cycle to boost Republicans running for the House. And a different PAC he backed spent $10 million to help Republicans in the Senate.\n\nSome Democrats celebrated Mr. Musk’s criticism. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, brought a printed-out copy of Mr. Musk’s X posts to the party’s weekly news conference on Tuesday.\n\n“He’s right,” Mr. Schumer said. “Republicans should listen to him.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr. Musk — who appeared onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February with a chain saw and said it would be “easy” to save the government billions of dollars — shared a meme on X that included a photo of fingertips pinching a minuscule pair of scissors.\n\n“Republicans getting ready to reduce the size of government,” the caption read.\n\nShawn McCreesh , Theodore Schleifer and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.",

In a text message to Politico, he instead attributed Biden's poor performance to advisers, who had \"isolated him from domestic politics.\"\n\nIn the letters he sent Wednesday, Comer requested the aides appear before the committee for transcribed interviews in the middle of July.\n\n\"If White House staff carried out a strategy lasting months or even years to hide the chief executive's condition–or to perform his duties–Congress may need to consider a legislative response,\" the Kentucky Republican wrote.\n\nAs chair of the House Oversight committee, Comer oversaw a long-running investigation trying to connect President Biden to the business dealings of his son Hunter. That investigation culminated in an impeachment inquiry that eventually stalled out before coming to a vote.",

        "content": "Donald Trump’s preoccupation with Joe Biden has appeared unhealthy for quite some time. On Memorial Day, for example, the Republican president promoted an online item that described his Democratic predecessor, who had recently been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, as “a decrepit corpse.”\n\nOn Friday, the incumbent went further, urging people not to feel sympathy for Biden as he combats cancer — “because he’s vicious.” His claim was rooted in the absurd Republican conspiracy theory that Biden personally executed a secret plot that culminated in Trump’s 2023 criminal indictments.\n\nBut as it turns out, the day after the Republican president made these public comments at an Oval Office event, Trump apparently took an interest in an even more unhinged conspiracy theory. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday night reposted a baseless claim on Truth Social that former President Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced with clones or robots. The original post, made by an anonymous Truth Social user who often spreads outlandish claims, suggested that Biden was replaced with “clones, doubles” and “robotic engineered soulless mindless entities.”\n\nPeriodically, the political world ponders a parlor game of sorts, based on an unfortunate question: “What’s the most bananas idea Donald Trump has ever endorsed, promoted or amplified?” The competition has long been fierce.\n\nIndeed, just in recent weeks, the current president has used his social media platform to amplify all kinds of truly bizarre claims and arguments, ranging from targeting Barack Obama with a military tribunal, accusing federal judges of committing acts “tantamount to treason and sedition,” to suggestions that Trump should be chosen to serve as the pope.\n\nBut for those who partake in this little parlor game, there’s clearly a new frontrunner.\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump used his social media platform to amplify an item that claimed that Biden was secretly “executed in 2020,” at which point the public saw “clones,” “doubles” and “robotic engineered soulless mindless entities” that appeared to be the Delaware Democrat.\n\nTo be sure, the Republican didn’t personally write this message, but he nevertheless thought it’d be a good idea to amplify the missive, bringing it to the attention of his millions of online followers.\n\nAs for why in the world Trump did this, The New York Times reported, “The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the post about Mr. Biden, whom Mr. Trump has targeted for criticism almost daily since the start of his second term.”\n\nWhether the incumbent president realizes this or not, he’s gradually discrediting his own weird campaign against his predecessor. In recent weeks, fueled in part by the book “Original Sin” by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Trump has argued — publicly and in apparent seriousness — that the entire Biden administration was “illegal,” because the Democrat was so incapacitated that his presidency was reduced to “autopen.”\n\nBut if the goal is to reinforce concerns about Biden’s mental health and acuity, Trump has it backwards.\n\nConsider what this story would look like if their situations were reversed. Imagine Biden were in the White House right now, and he decided to use his social media account to amplify a message that accused Trump of being dead and replaced by robotic clones.\n\nI suspect that if the Democrat were to do this, there would be widespread concern that the president had gone completely around the bend. And yet, here we are.\n\nFor those concerned about elderly presidents and their cognitive abilities, there’s one key truth that shouldn’t get lost in the shuffle: Biden isn’t the one amplifying a message about his former rival secretly being a dead robot.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is expected to interview former Hunter Biden special counsel David Weiss behind closed doors on Friday, two sources familiar with the interview told CNN, as part of a broader Republican effort to revisit previous probes into the Biden family that stalled last Congress but are gaining new momentum now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe scheduled interview, which could still be moved, would be the second time the Republican-led panel will interview Weiss about his work as Republicans continue to probe whether the investigation was hampered by political interference.\n\nWeiss has still never testified publicly about his six-year criminal probe into the president’s son, which included three convictions, but was ultimately short-circuited as a result of the former president’s unconditional pardon of his son.\n\nHouse Judiciary Republicans have long wanted to call Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney, back for questioning after his first closed-door interview in 2023. Committee Republicans were also able to finally secure interviews with two Department of Justice tax division prosecutors involved in the Hunter Biden probe who they had been aggressively pursuing for months, one of the sources familiar told CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department is working with Weiss to provide access to documents he may need for his interview, a person briefed on the matter said. Any delays in getting access to documents would be a scheduling issue and the ability to have personnel who can oversee it, the person briefed on the matter said.\n\nIt’s not the only Biden investigation Republicans are reexamining that leans into a fresh political appetite with GOP control of Washington.\n\nHouse Oversight Chair James Comer is returning to his probe of the former president’s mental fitness in an entirely new landscape after a recent book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson put Joe Biden’s physical and mental decline back in the spotlight.\n\nComer told CNN he is in the process of scheduling key interviews with Biden’s White House physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, and other senior aides who had all rebuffed his efforts last Congress. Beyond the five initial interviews from Biden’s orbit, the Republican Chairman told CNN he wants to look at the executive orders Biden signed in his last six months in office and use of the autopen.\n\nIn the weeks immediately after Biden’s disastrous 2024 debate performance that unraveled his presidential campaign and upended the Democratic party, Comer requested to interview Biden’s doctor and subpoenaed three senior Biden aides to discuss their roles in the Biden White House, which never materialized.\n\nNow, Comer said in an interview with CNN, “it is a whole different environment.”\n\nAt the time of his 2024 interview requests, Comer’s impeachment inquiry into the Biden family’s business dealings had fallen apart and the Biden administration felt no incentive to comply with the House Oversight Committee.\n\nProbing Biden’s decline now, Comer says, will be a lot easier than trying to convince his colleagues of an alleged Biden family foreign influence peddling scheme, which even Comer conceded was difficult to do, particularly in a minute or less on Fox News. Republicans failed to uncover evidence to support their core allegations against the president, and lacked the votes in their divided, narrow majority last Congress to impeach the president.\n\n“The money laundering and the shell companies, the average American couldn’t understand that. I mean, that was hard to understand,” Comer told CNN. “You know, I did not do a good job explaining that.”\n\nBut with his investigation into Biden’s mental and physical decline, Comer said, “people see a president that clearly is in decline. They saw it in the debate.”\n\nDemocrats sought to dismantle the Republican-led 11 month impeachment inquiry into Biden last Congress at every turn.\n\nComer told CNN that although those Democrats aren’t jumping at the opportunity to cooperate now, he does not see them as being obstructive either.\n\n“I take that as a step in the right direction,” he told CNN.\n\nTapper and Thompson’s book documents how Biden, his closest aides and his family forged ahead with the former president’s doomed 2024 reelection bid despite signs of his physical and mental decline.\n\nIn a previous statement to CNN, a Biden spokesman criticized the book, saying that evidence shows that “he was a very effective president.”\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips, who launched a long-shot challenge to Biden and was outspoken about his concerns over the former president’s age, told CNN he did not think there needed to be an investigation on Capitol Hill at this point into Biden’s fitness as president.\n\n“This case already went to trial, the jury of American voters convicted the party of the accused, and handed out the harshest political punishment possible-losing the single most consequential election in modern history,” Phillips told CNN.\n\nInstead, Phillips called on Biden to authorize his physician to disclose his health file and condition under oath.\n\n“Only if the former president refuses, or if questioning uncovers possible criminal activity, should an investigation be initiated,” Phillips added.\n\nBiden was recently diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

        "content": "The jet engine technology that powers airplanes comes mostly from U.S. companies, but the engines can’t function without rare earth minerals that are manufactured largely in China.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade conflict is quickly morphing into a fight over global supply chains, as the two nations limit the sharing of critical technologies that could have lasting consequences for scores of industries.\n\nThe United States last week suspended some sales to China of components and software used in jet engines and semiconductors, a response to a clampdown by Beijing on the export of minerals used in large sectors of manufacturing. Both sides over the last few days have accused the other of operating in bad faith.\n\nThe supply chain warfare, which comes on top of tariffs the two countries have inflicted on the other’s imports, has alarmed companies that say they cannot make their products without components sourced from both. And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States, including pharmaceuticals or shipping.\n\n“The supply chain wars that we’ve been speculating about for years are now happening,” said Liza Tobin, a former White House national security adviser who is now the managing director at Garnaut Global, a risk advisory firm.\n\nIn recent weeks, the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon, and a victim, in this fight.\n\nThe jet engine technology that powers airplanes, and the navigation systems that control them, largely come from the United States, developed by companies like General Electric. In China’s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing, for example, it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.\n\nBut a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures, as well as other uses.\n\nBeijing restricted exports of those minerals, known as rare earths, in April after President Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States — including the work done by many defense contractors. In May, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.\n\nThe United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week, U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China, as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors, people familiar with the move say.\n\nAt the same time, officials in the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths, including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nBut any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average, it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine, according to statistics from S&P.\n\nThe Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers, as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other’s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term, many American companies established factories in countries outside of China, including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nEven so, the economies remain deeply integrated, an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons, doing so will be expensive and painful.\n\nSince 2022, for example, the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.\n\nThe United States has extended these export controls around the world, even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts, technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules, many have fallen in line.\n\nImage The U.S. and Chinese economies remain deeply integrated, with hundreds of billions of dollars of trade flowing across the Pacific each year. Credit... The New York Times\n\nThis system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China, rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.\n\nBeijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths, and magnets made from them, to companies worldwide. When Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145 percent in April, Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths, including pausing many of them.\n\nIn May, American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China, and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China’s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.\n\nNegotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal, China said it would “suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April,” according to a joint statement.\n\nU.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday, Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, said that the Chinese were “slow-rolling their compliance” and that American officials “haven’t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nMr. Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, he wrote that China had “TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” adding, “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday, saying that China had “earnestly implemented” the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal, including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei, the Chinese technology firm, anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.\n\n“The U.S., without any factual basis, has smeared and accused China, imposed export controls on chips, suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas — extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China’s legitimate rights and interests,” Mr. Lin said.\n\nWhile some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments, the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.\n\nThe tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States’ diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Communist Party.\n\nSo far, it is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had “no information to offer” on the call.\n\nDaniel H. Rosen, the co-founder of Rhodium Group, a research company, said that Beijing recognized years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidized the build-out of those supplies. The United States, he added, “horribly underestimated” the demand for them.\n\nChina mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, but it does the chemical processing for 90 percent of them. The country also makes more than 80 percent of the world’s batteries, more than 70 percent of its electric cars, and about half of the world’s steel, iron and aluminum, according to data from the International Energy Agency.\n\nSecuring an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, Mr. Rosen said, and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside of China.\n\n“It’s going to be expensive,” he said. “We have a long way to go.”\n\nWhile some shipments of minerals have restarted, many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo, a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group, said the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April, when Mr. Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.\n\nMr. Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue, as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.\n\n“This problem is deep and long lasting,” he said. “It will not go away, or be easily solved.”\n\nChris Buckley , Keith Bradsher and Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting and research.",

        "summary": "President Trump imposed high tariffs on Chinese imports. In April, Beijing responded by restricting rare earth exports and pausing many shipments. In May, Ford Motor temporarily closed a Chicago factory due to a magnet shortage. The United States suspended some sales of jet engine and semiconductor components and software to China. US officials accelerated efforts to find more domestic rare earth supplies, considering funding for new mines. The Trump administration considered adding major Chinese chipmakers and tech giants (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu units) to an entity list, prohibiting trade. After Trump levied tariffs, many American companies established factories outside China. China's Xi Jinping invested heavily in domestic semiconductor, solar panel, and EV factories to reduce foreign reliance. Since 2022, the United States expanded a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and prevent their flow to China. The US extended these export controls globally, forbidding foreign companies from selling products to China if they use American parts, technology, or software. Beijing set up a licensing system to monitor and approve worldwide sales of rare earths and magnets. In May, American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva. In Geneva, negotiators agreed to lower tariffs, and China stated it would suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures taken since April. The Trump administration proposed plans to revoke visas of Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party."

        "content": "Let me cut to the chase. Even if there were a “cover up” of the previous president’s infirmity, that’s not why Donald Trump won.\n\nYet that is the allegation hiding in the subtext of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book. The sin in Original Sin is evidently the sin of pride, as in: Joe Biden was just too damn proud to let go of power. And due to his sinfulness, our democracy is now on the brink of collapse.\n\nMost of the attention seems to be on the question of Biden’s cognitive decline. Virtually none is on the question itself and the reasons behind it. That’s because, according to the logic of the Washington press corps, it’s normal to blame Democrats for the choices of Republicans. The thinking goes that Trump didn’t win. Biden handed him victory.\n\nBecause Democrats are the only ones with agency, they are the only ones held accountable. Donald Trump and the Republicans are therefore free to say whatever they want with an understanding among reporters who provide coverage that there’s no stopping them.\n\nThis is why there was so much reporting on Biden’s age, before the election and now afterward, but nothing close to equivalent coverage of the current president’s blindingly obvious mental deterioration. If there was a cover up for Biden, there is surely a cover up for Trump. But given the state of today’s news, we may never know about it.\n\nThe impact of this double standard goes beyond media framing. It can warp public understanding of politics, according to Scott Lemieux. Scott teaches constitutional law at the University of Washington. He’s probably best known as co-founder of Lawyers, Guns and Money.\n\nIn this interview with me, Scott explains why he believes that even if Biden had dropped out after the 2022 midterms, Vice President Kamala Harris would have been the Democratic Party’s nominee.\n\nScott said that to say Trump won because Biden didn't step down “is at best a vast oversimplification driven by a political vision in which Democrats are the only actors (and letting the press entirely off the hook for the normalization of Trump, even in the wake of January 6.)”\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's establish some facts. Was there a cover up? Or are Tapper and Thompson pandering to the Republicans by piling on Biden?\n\nThis may not be a fully satisfying answer, but I think there's some of both. Clearly, Tapper and Thompson are playing on Biden's unpopularity and Republican desires to distract from Trump’s countless problems to sell books. But Biden does seem to have declined pretty substantially in his last 12 to 18 months in office. I think it's clear he should not have run again, and Biden's inner circle were not sufficiently candid with the public, or in advising the president.\n\nHow do this play into your view of Tapper and Thompson's book? Trump isn't a spring chicken either. He's corrupt to the core. Yet Tapper said recently that this “cover up” was worse than Watergate .\n\nUnlike EMAILS, or most of the Hunter Biden stuff, Biden's age and ability to run again, and the conduct of his closest advisors, were real issues worthy of coverage. But there remain real questions of proportionality. The risks of an aging president \"mysteriously\" became much less central to press coverage when Harris became the Democratic nominee, and the full-court press on this book is detracting from Trump's increasing incoherence and apparent lack of command of the policies being issued by his own administration.\n\nObviously, Tapper and Thompson have a book to sell, and it is what it is, but people will have a legitimate beef against the press if Trump’s age and decline don't get a proportionate amount of coverage.\n\nWe're talking about more than proportionality. We're talking about a press corps that tends to hold the Democrats accountable for the Republicans' choices. The New Yorker excerpt of Original Sin was titled \" How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump .\"\n\nI would also take issue with the empirical assumption being made.\n\nWhile I agree that Biden should not have run again, had he stepped down after the midterms, the result probably would have been Vice President Kamala Harris still being the nominee after an extremely divisive primary in which Gaza would have played a major role.\n\nAny serious analysis of the 2024 elections needs to start with the fact that Harris did better than any other peer incumbent since 2021. That's not to say that she was a perfect candidate or ran a flawless campaign, but \"Trump only won because Biden didn't step down in 2022\" is at best a vast oversimplification driven by a political vision in which Democrats are the only actors (and letting the press entirely off the hook for the normalization of Trump, even in the wake of January 6.)\n\nRelated to the “cover up” of Biden's age are the allegations that elite Democrats covered up the truth about Biden's primary victory in 2020. You wrote recently about how this book invites rewriting that history, and rewriting it badly. Can you explain?\n\nTapper recently asserted that the 2020 primary was the result of a metaphorical \"smoke filled room\" in which \"Barack Obama and others called Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Booker and Warren and all the others, and encouraged them to drop out and get behind Biden.\"\n\nFirst, there's the factual sloppiness. Booker dropped out in January, Warren (and Bloomberg) didn't drop out before Super Tuesday. That sloppiness isn't just incidental. When you look at what really happened -- two minor candidates with little money and who had no appeal outside of the small white rural states frontloaded in the process dropped out, as happens in every competitive primary -- it's very, very obvious that it was immaterial to the outcome of the race.\n\nWhat actually happened is that Democratic elites were at best mostly lukewarm about Biden, and were hoping that a younger candidate would emerge. I'm sure there was some coordination between Obama and Klobuchar/Buttegeig after South Carolina and Alabama, but the conventional wisdom Tapper repeats gets cause and effect backwards. Party elites wanted to unite around Biden, because his win had become inevitable. It wasn't the reason Biden's win was inevitable.\n\nAn honest account of the 2020 primary would start with the fact that Biden was (for better or worse) the clear choice of Democratic voters, not the result of some elite conspiracy. And going forward, the left of the party needs to recognize that the strategy pursued by Bernie Sanders in 2020 -- run a factional campaign and hope to win as a minority candidate at a contested convention -- was a dead end, tactically and democratically, that shouldn't be tried again.\n\nLast question. Swing for the fences. Why is political journalism so dumb? It could be really good, but it's not. And it's making us dumber. There seems to be no incentive in the other direction.\n\nThis is a complex question. I'm not sure I understand why. Obviously, there's plenty of good work being done by individual reporters and outlets. The biggest problem is at the editorial level. As you said earlier, there's a strong latent tendency to make Democrats the main characters of the political universe, and hold them to higher standards. This was particularly evident in 2016, when Trump was covered as a sideshow and Clinton was covered as if she was the president-elect.\n\nOne really glaring example was the refusal of any mainstream outlet to publish any of the hacked material about the Trump campaign provided by Iranian intelligence . In isolation, this is perfectly defensible. None of the material that surfaced was particularly interesting, and I think there should be a pretty tough standard for publishing hacked material, because of the bad incentives.\n\nBut it's impossible to square with the media's conduct in 2016, in which hacked material spun on behalf of Trump received enormous amounts of coverage despite containing no serious news value.\n\nThe press is not obliged to learn from its mistakes, but it owed the public an explanation, and the fact that editors generally didn't feel that it was owed one is very telling. I don't think there's an easy solution, but we need to start by acknowledging there's a real problem.\n\nNOW READ: The question no one is asking",

The adaptation’s repeated opening verse: “Impeachment is the answer.”\n\nThe day after Mr. Yoon’s short-lived declaration of martial law last week, the protest anthem’s creator, Baek Jae Gil, performed it for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul. A recording has received nine million views on X, and the song has spread on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. On the Chinese app WeChat, it has been translated into Chinese, he said.\n\n“If Yoon Suk Yeol gets lost, it’s a Merry Christmas,” the crowd sang along to the tune of the 1970 Christmas classic.\n\nMr. Baek, 52, a professional musician known as Baekja, has been protesting for decades. He has seen demonstrations become more peaceful and the mood lighten since his first rally in 1989. That was during a brutally suppressed teachers movement that led to the formation of a national union.\n\n“It was scary,” he said of those days in an interview last Saturday during protests at the National Assembly. “It was the time of tear gas and violent repression.”\n\nGrowing up as the youngest of six children in South Korea’s southwest, Mr. Baek said, he often heard stories from his older brothers about how soldiers suppressed pro-democracy protests in the nearby city of Gwangju in 1980, the last time South Korea was under martial law.\n\n“My brother was almost killed,” he said, adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses.\n\nIn middle school, he moved to Seoul at his brothers’ recommendation to find better opportunities.

About a dozen protesters died setting themselves on fire.\n\n“I sang in the midst of tear gas every week,” he said.\n\nIn the past two decades, the police tactics to suppress demonstrations have become less violent. He said that protest culture changed significantly during candlelight vigils in 2002 in response to the deaths of two schoolgirls fatally struck by a U.S. Army vehicle. A U.S. military court acquitted two soldiers in the crash, sparking anger, but the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nMr. Baek also saw the mood at demonstrations become brighter after the protests against President Park Geun-hye, some of the largest the country has seen, led to her impeachment in 2016. People were jubilant, he said: A peaceful protest had toppled the country’s leader.\n\n“Protests in South Korea went from being dark and depressing to being fun and exciting,” Mr. Baek said. “There was a sense of pride in democracy.”\n\nThose demonstrations provided the inspiration for his “Feliz Navidad” adaptation. A protester performed a version of the song, originally written by the Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano, titled “Geun-hye Is Not the One.”\n\n(Mr. Feliciano did not comment directly on the latest adaptation. Susan Feliciano, his wife, said in a statement that the lyrics have been repurposed often and that it was gratifying to see the melody endure.)\n\nMr. Baek wrote his version in 2022, after Mr. Yoon had become president. Protests calling for his removal grew after a crowd crush in Seoul around Halloween killed more than 150 people. Mr. Baek wanted to come up with a song fit for the run-up to Christmas.\n\n“The response has been great,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s a Christmas carol.”\n\nMr. Baek has run into trouble with other satirical songs. A government-run broadcaster accused him of copyright infringement earlier this year after he used part of its footage in a YouTube video satirizing the material. At the broadcaster’s request, YouTube deleted his video, and the police launched an investigation. Mr. Baek said he was fighting the case, calling it a targeted infringement on his free speech rights.\n\nLast week, the day after hundreds of soldiers stormed the National Assembly, he sang his anthem and several other songs there to an energized audience that was younger than those he had seen at previous rallies.\n\n“Let’s make Yoon Suk Yeol’s arrest our Christmas gift this year!” he shouted before performing for a crowd of protesters.\n\nMr. Baek, who sang it again on a stage at last Saturday’s protests, said that he liked to lift people’s mood.\n\n“The wind is biting, isn’t it?” he told thousands of protesters as wind swept his brown-highlighted perm. “If you’re cold, get up and dance!”\n\nThe crowd rose and cheered.",

A U.S. military court acquitted two soldiers in the crash, sparking anger, but the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nMr. Baek also saw the mood at demonstrations become brighter after the protests against President Park Geun-hye, some of the largest the country has seen, led to her impeachment in 2016. People were jubilant, he said: A peaceful protest had toppled the country’s leader.\n\n“Protests in South Korea went from being dark and depressing to being fun and exciting,” Mr. Baek said. “There was a sense of pride in democracy.”\n\nThose demonstrations provided the inspiration for his “Feliz Navidad” adaptation. A protester performed a version of the song, originally written by the Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano, titled “Geun-hye Is Not the One.”\n\n(Mr. Feliciano did not comment directly on the latest adaptation. Susan Feliciano, his wife, said in a statement that the lyrics have been repurposed often and that it was gratifying to see the melody endure.)\n\nMr. Baek wrote his version in 2022, after Mr. Yoon had become president. Protests calling for his removal grew after a crowd crush in Seoul around Halloween killed more than 150 people. Mr. Baek wanted to come up with a song fit for the run-up to Christmas.\n\n“The response has been great,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s a Christmas carol.”\n\nMr. Baek has run into trouble with other satirical songs. A government-run broadcaster accused him of copyright infringement earlier this year after he used part of its footage in a YouTube video satirizing the material. At the broadcaster’s request, YouTube deleted his video, and the police launched an investigation. Mr. Baek said he was fighting the case, calling it a targeted infringement on his free speech rights.\n\nLast week, the day after hundreds of soldiers stormed the National Assembly, he sang his anthem and several other songs there to an energized audience that was younger than those he had seen at previous rallies.\n\n“Let’s make Yoon Suk Yeol’s arrest our Christmas gift this year!” he shouted before performing for a crowd of protesters.\n\nMr. Baek, who sang it again on a stage at last Saturday’s protests, said that he liked to lift people’s mood.\n\n“The wind is biting, isn’t it?” he told thousands of protesters as wind swept his brown-highlighted perm. “If you’re cold, get up and dance!”\n\nThe crowd rose and cheered."

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.\n\nYoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.\n\nActing chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”\n\nIf confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.\n\nThe now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.\n\nA former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.\n\nPark Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.\n\nHis administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.\n\nYoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.\n\nPolice raids and treason investigations\n\nIn his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.\n\nBut it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.\n\nDramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.\n\nSoldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law.

        "content": "The stakes are high for President Yoon Suk-yeol as the opposition tries again to impeach him for declaring martial law.\n\nSeoul, South Korea – South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is set to face a second impeachment motion in the National Assembly on Saturday, just a week after a previous attempt by the political opposition fell short.\n\nThe stakes are high following Yoon’s controversial declaration of martial law on December 3, which triggered nationwide protests and heightened uncertainty for Asia’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nFor the latest impeachment motion to succeed, it must secure at least 200 votes – a two-thirds majority – in South Korea’s 300-seat National Assembly.\n\nThe opposition bloc holds 192 seats, leaving it eight votes short of the number required.\n\nHowever, in recent days, a small yet growing number of legislators from Yoon’s governing People Power Party have openly supported the motion, making impeachment increasingly more likely.\n\nIn a defiant televised address on Thursday, Yoon dismissed the idea of voluntary resignation, stressing, “Whether they impeach me or investigate me, I will stand firm.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens if Yoon is impeached?\n\nIf the National Assembly passes the impeachment motion, a series of legal and constitutional processes will unfold, starting with the official delivery of the impeachment resolution from the National Assembly to the President’s Office and the Constitutional Court.\n\nFrom that moment, Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended. He will still retain the title and some privileges associated with the presidency, including the presidential residence, and continued security protection.\n\nDuring this period, South Korea’s prime minister will assume the role of acting president under Article 71 of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the opposition is also considering impeaching Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in connection with his possible role in the martial law declaration. If Han is impeached, too, the deputy prime minister for the economy would take over as acting president.\n\nThe acting president will handle essential duties such as military command, issuing decrees, and managing state matters.\n\nWhile the Constitution does not clearly limit the scope of an acting president’s authority, precedent suggests powers should be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than initiating major policy changes.\n\nReview at the Constitutional Court\n\nThe impeachment process then moves to the Constitutional Court, where justices will review the case to determine whether Yoon’s removal is justified.\n\nAt least six out of the nine justices must support the motion for it to be upheld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, only six justices currently sit on the bench, meaning Yoon needs just one supportive ruling to survive the impeachment attempt.\n\nThe three vacant seats are positions that the National Assembly can nominate. While legislators are now rushing to fill those seats, the president has the final authority to approve the appointments, raising the possibility of delays or rejections.\n\nThe court is required to issue its decision within 180 days of receiving the case. The Constitutional Court took 63 days to rule on former President Roh Moo-hyun’s impeachment in 2004 and 91 days for former President Park Geun-hye’s case in 2016.\n\nYoon’s potential legal defence\n\nYoon’s speech on Thursday appeared to preview his defence strategy should the case reach the Constitutional Court.\n\nHe is likely to argue that declaring martial law was within his constitutional powers and did not constitute an illegal act or an insurrection.\n\nHe framed the martial law declaration as a “highly political decision” falling under the president’s powers, which are “not subject to judicial review”.\n\nYoon insisted that his decision was an “emergency appeal to the public” amid what he described as a severe political crisis, which he blamed on the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\n\nConstitutional Court’s ruling\n\nIf the court upholds the impeachment, Yoon will be removed from office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will lose privileges afforded to former presidents, such as pensions and personal aides, though he will continue to receive security protection.\n\nA presidential election must then be held within 60 days to elect a new leader.\n\nIf the impeachment is rejected, Yoon will be reinstated as president and resume his duties.\n\nSeparate investigations\n\nEven if he survives the second impeachment bid, Yoon still faces criminal investigations.\n\nAlthough a sitting president enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution, this protection does not extend to charges of insurrection.\n\nMultiple investigative agencies, including the police, the prosecution, and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, are investigating senior officials and military commanders on charges of insurrection.\n\nThis means that Yoon could potentially be arrested, which would mark the first such case involving a sitting president in South Korea.",

        "ori_content": "The stakes are high for President Yoon Suk-yeol as the opposition tries again to impeach him for declaring martial law.\n\nSeoul, South Korea – South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is set to face a second impeachment motion in the National Assembly on Saturday, just a week after a previous attempt by the political opposition fell short.\n\nThe stakes are high following Yoon’s controversial declaration of martial law on December 3, which triggered nationwide protests and heightened uncertainty for Asia’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nFor the latest impeachment motion to succeed, it must secure at least 200 votes – a two-thirds majority – in South Korea’s 300-seat National Assembly.\n\nThe opposition bloc holds 192 seats, leaving it eight votes short of the number required.\n\nHowever, in recent days, a small yet growing number of legislators from Yoon’s governing People Power Party have openly supported the motion, making impeachment increasingly more likely.\n\nIn a defiant televised address on Thursday, Yoon dismissed the idea of voluntary resignation, stressing, “Whether they impeach me or investigate me, I will stand firm.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens if Yoon is impeached?\n\nIf the National Assembly passes the impeachment motion, a series of legal and constitutional processes will unfold, starting with the official delivery of the impeachment resolution from the National Assembly to the President’s Office and the Constitutional Court.\n\nFrom that moment, Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended. He will still retain the title and some privileges associated with the presidency, including the presidential residence, and continued security protection.\n\nDuring this period, South Korea’s prime minister will assume the role of acting president under Article 71 of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the opposition is also considering impeaching Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in connection with his possible role in the martial law declaration. If Han is impeached, too, the deputy prime minister for the economy would take over as acting president.\n\nThe acting president will handle essential duties such as military command, issuing decrees, and managing state matters.\n\nWhile the Constitution does not clearly limit the scope of an acting president’s authority, precedent suggests powers should be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than initiating major policy changes.\n\nReview at the Constitutional Court\n\nThe impeachment process then moves to the Constitutional Court, where justices will review the case to determine whether Yoon’s removal is justified.\n\nAt least six out of the nine justices must support the motion for it to be upheld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, only six justices currently sit on the bench, meaning Yoon needs just one supportive ruling to survive the impeachment attempt.\n\nThe three vacant seats are positions that the National Assembly can nominate. While legislators are now rushing to fill those seats, the president has the final authority to approve the appointments, raising the possibility of delays or rejections.\n\nThe court is required to issue its decision within 180 days of receiving the case. The Constitutional Court took 63 days to rule on former President Roh Moo-hyun’s impeachment in 2004 and 91 days for former President Park Geun-hye’s case in 2016.\n\nYoon’s potential legal defence\n\nYoon’s speech on Thursday appeared to preview his defence strategy should the case reach the Constitutional Court.\n\nHe is likely to argue that declaring martial law was within his constitutional powers and did not constitute an illegal act or an insurrection.\n\nHe framed the martial law declaration as a “highly political decision” falling under the president’s powers, which are “not subject to judicial review”.\n\nYoon insisted that his decision was an “emergency appeal to the public” amid what he described as a severe political crisis, which he blamed on the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\n\nConstitutional Court’s ruling\n\nIf the court upholds the impeachment, Yoon will be removed from office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will lose privileges afforded to former presidents, such as pensions and personal aides, though he will continue to receive security protection.\n\nA presidential election must then be held within 60 days to elect a new leader.\n\nIf the impeachment is rejected, Yoon will be reinstated as president and resume his duties.\n\nSeparate investigations\n\nEven if he survives the second impeachment bid, Yoon still faces criminal investigations.\n\nAlthough a sitting president enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution, this protection does not extend to charges of insurrection.\n\nMultiple investigative agencies, including the police, the prosecution, and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, are investigating senior officials and military commanders on charges of insurrection.\n\nThis means that Yoon could potentially be arrested, which would mark the first such case involving a sitting president in South Korea."

But those cuts are likely to be less drastic, according to one of the three officials. (Colard refused to provide the number of externals currently employed in the communications department.)\n\nOverall, the Parliament’s outreach and campaign activities are likely to be most affected. Specifically, the administration is considering withdrawing funding for events such as the Brussels 20-kilometer race, grants for organizations at the regional and local level, and art exhibitions, according to a draft plan seen by POLITICO.\n\nIt may also slash part of its budget for awards, according to the three Parliament officials, including the LUX Audience Award for films, the European Citizen’s Prize and the European Charlemagne Youth Prize for youth projects promoting democracy.\n\nThe Europa Experience initiative, a project to establish EU-themed spaces across all 27 member countries, has already suffered cuts because of soaring costs and lackluster visitor numbers.\n\nThe uncertainty has caused some staffers to look elsewhere to build their careers, especially in the newly created legislative directorates, according to two of the officials POLITICO spoke to. “The feeling now is that the future is in the new directorates if you want to grow professionally,” one of them said.",

        "content": "As the Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) prepares to reconvene, the South Sudan Land Alliance (SSuLA), a coalition of civil society organizations and land rights advocates, has called on the House to prioritize the passage of the National Land Policy, stressing that continued delays are detrimental.\n\nThe policy, which was approved by the Council of Ministers on 27 October 2023 and tabled before the TNLA on 21 November 2024, has been in development for nearly two decades.\n\nAddressing journalists on Wednesday in Juba, Dorothy Drabuga, the chairperson of the Alliance, emphasized the importance of passing the policy to address ongoing land-related challenges in South Sudan.\n\n“In advance of parliament’s reopening, SSuLA, backed by more than 50 national and international organizations and with support from the Rights and Resources Initiatives (RRI), has released an open letter urging lawmakers to pass the NLP without further delay,” she said.\n\nAccording to Drabuga, a campaign titled Land for South Sudan highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive framework to resolve land disputes, secure land tenure, and promote sustainable development, particularly for Indigenous Peoples, local communities, women, and youth.\n\n“For nearly 20 years, South Sudanese communities have waited for a land policy that safeguards their rights, reduces conflict, and unlocks development opportunities,” she stated. “With Parliament set to reopen, we urge lawmakers to act boldly and make the National Land Policy a top legislative priority.”\n\nAdditionally, the SSuLA chairperson noted that the policy’s delay continues to impede the implementation of critical provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement (R-ARCSS), signed on 18 September 2018.\n\n“Article 4.8.2.1.1 of the agreement mandates the timely development and implementation of a national land policy as part of the broader land reform agenda,” she said. “In the open letter addressed to Rt. Hon. Speaker Jemma Nunu Kumba and Hon. Ambrose Lomin, Chairperson of the Committee on Land and Physical Infrastructure, SSuLA, outline three urgent calls to action.”\n\nShe explained that the letter urges parliament to accelerate deliberation and approve the NLP without further delay, commit financial and technical resources for its implementation, and ensure that the policy aligns with international standards for land rights, particularly those of marginalized communities.\n\n“The NLP represents more than legislation. It is a pathway to peace, equity, and environmental resilience,” Drabuga stressed. “Failure to act risks deepening land disputes, discouraging sustainable investment, and worsening climate vulnerability.”\n\nWith land-related conflicts persisting across the country, advocates argue that the passage of the NLP would mark a historic step toward stability and inclusive development.\n\nFor his part, Ter Manyang, Executive Director of the Center for Peace and Advocacy (CPA), emphasized the fact that there is a need for the creation of legal awareness and implementation of the current laws, especially where there are currently rampant land disputes.\n\n“Many women are unaware of their rights under statutory law, and even when aware, they may face difficulties in asserting those rights due to a lack of awareness or resources,” he stated. “Institutional barriers and gender-biased practices within the justice system also impede women’s access to redress for land-related violations.”\n\nFurthermore, the Center for Peace and Advocacy called for coordinated efforts between the government, land institutions, and other partner organizations operating in South Sudan.\n\n“Addressing women’s land rights requires a multi-faceted approach, including strengthening legal frameworks, promoting gender equality in land administration, raising awareness of women’s rights, and ensuring access to justice,” he said.\n\nAccording to Manyang, there is a need for increased coordination among land actors, including government agencies, NGOs, and community organizations.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament approved a significant position regarding EU standards for the breeding, housing, and handling of cats and dogs. This initiative introduces the first EU regulations focused on the welfare and traceability of dogs and cats, with a vote resulting in 35 in favour, two against, and nine abstentions. Given that approximately 44% of households within the EU have a pet, the trade in dogs and cats has expanded notably in recent years, now valued at €1.3 billion annually, as reported by the Commission. It is worth noting that the online market, including illegal activities, accounts for 60% of all dog and cat sales in the EU.\n\nIn response to the absence of unified minimum animal welfare standards across member states, the Commission proposed these new rules on 7 December 2023. The regulations would apply to individuals and entities involved in breeding or selling dogs and cats in establishments and shelters, as well as those facilitating placements into foster homes. However, the regulations will not extend to private dog and cat owners who occasionally place a maximum of one litter on the market, provided this occurs less frequently than every 18 months.\n\nUnder the proposed regulations, all dogs and cats held by breeders, sellers, and shelters, or those offered for sale or donation online, must be individually identifiable through microchipping. These microchipped animals are required to be registered in interoperable national databases. The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) propose that the identification numbers of microchips, along with relevant details regarding the corresponding national database, be maintained in a single index database managed by the Commission.\n\nTo address potential loopholes that could allow dogs and cats to enter the EU as non-commercial pets, which may later be sold, MEPs recommend extending the proposed rules to encompass not only imports for commercial purposes but also non-commercial movements. Accordingly, dogs and cats imported from third countries for sale must be microchipped before entering the EU and subsequently registered in a national database within two working days of arrival. Additionally, pet owners arriving in the EU will be required to pre-register their microchipped animals in an online database at least five working days prior to their arrival.\n\nThe proposed regulations also prohibit breeding between direct relatives, including parents and offspring, grandparents and grandchildren, as well as between siblings and half-siblings. Puppies and kittens may not be separated from their mothers until they have reached a minimum age of eight weeks unless specific veterinary justification is provided. To ensure ethical practices, the regulations will limit the number of litters a female may have and will establish mandatory rest periods between pregnancies.\n\nFurthermore, the MEPs advocate for a prohibition on breeding dogs or cats with excessive conformational traits that may lead to significant welfare issues, as well as banning these animals—along with mutilated dogs and cats—from participating in shows, exhibitions, or competitions. The report is now prepared for a vote in the Parliament’s plenary session. If adopted, negotiations with EU government ministers will commence.\n\n“This proposal is a clear move against illegal breeding and the irresponsible importation of animals from outside the EU. At the same time, it fully respects ordinary owners and responsible breeders who should not be unduly burdened by regulations,” rapporteur and Chair of the AGRI Committee, Veronika Vrecionová (ECR, CZ), said after the vote.",

EMSC is reporting the same magnitude and depth, while the Thai Meteorological Department put the magnitude at 8.2. The quake was followed by a strong aftershock measuring M6.7 just 12 minutes later.\n\nThe epicenter was located 16 km (10 miles) NNW of Sagaing (population 78 739), 17 km (11 miles) WNW of Mandalay (population 1 208 099), and 55 km (34 miles) W of Pyon Oo Lwin (population 117 303), Myanmar.\n\n2 681 000 people are estimated to have felt violent shaking, 4 568 000 severe, 3 307 000 very strong and 13 716 000 strong.\n\nThe USGS issued a Red alert for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response.\n\nOverall, the population in this region resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist. The predominant vulnerable building types are informal (metal, timber, GI etc.) and unreinforced brick masonry construction.\n\nRecent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards, such as landslides, that might have contributed to losses.\n\nEstimated economic losses may exceed the GDP of Burma.\n\nLiquefaction triggered by this earthquake is estimated to be extensive in severity and (or) spatial extent. The number of people living near areas that could have produced liquefaction in this earthquake is extensive.\n\nLandslides triggered by this earthquake are estimated to be significant in number and (or) spatial extent.\n\nThis is the second M6+ earthquake of the day, following M6.1 near Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago at 00:34 UTC.\n\nThis is also the strongest earthquake so far this year, followed by M7.6 in Cayman Island on February 9 and M7.1 in Western Xizang, China on January 7.\n\nLe prime immagini dei danni provocati dal violento #terremoto di M 7.7 che pochi minuti fa è avvenuto in #Myanmar.

La scossa è stata inoltre avvertita fino in Vietnam e Thailandia. pic.twitter.com/i6yu3M9L9U — Il Mondo dei Terremoti (@mondoterremoti) March 28, 2025\n\nThe quake caused significant damage, including collapsed buildings in Mandalay and road buckling in Naypyidaw, and was felt in Thailand and China, affecting millions and displacing many in an already vulnerable region.\n\nOver 1 000 people were killed and more than 2 400 injured, according to reports received on March 29, with casualty numbers expected to rise as reports from rural areas continue to emerge.\n\nNational phone and internet infrastructure suffered extensive disruption, hampering rescue and communication efforts. The National Unity Government of Myanmar reported the destruction or severe damage of at least 2 970 residential buildings, 150 religious structures, 30 roads, and 7 bridges.\n\nThe Islamic community estimated nearly 300 deaths occurred during prayer time as over 50 mosques collapsed across the country.\n\nMandalay was among the hardest-hit areas, with at least 674 confirmed deaths, 1 670 injuries, and over 1 000 people reported missing. More than half of the city’s buildings were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nNotable incidents here included the collapse of Mandalay University buildings, fires on campus, and the failure of the Dokhtawaddy Bridge along the Yangon–Mandalay Expressway, where some vehicles reportedly plunged into the river. Over 30 mosques were destroyed in the region, many of them historic, with heavy casualties reported.\n\nA monastery collapse left over 600 monks trapped, of which 80 were confirmed dead. Several buildings in Maha Aungmye and Pyigyidagun townships collapsed, trapping dozens. The Mandalay Palace, Mahamuni Pagoda, and a local dam also sustained serious damage, while parts of the Mandalay-Yangon highway buckled. Additional fatalities were reported in Yamethin, Kyaukse, Pyawbwe, Meiktila, and Bone Oe, with 36 deaths in Wundwin and destruction reported in Madaya Township.\n\nSagaing Township experienced widespread structural failure, with nearly 50 deaths, 300 injuries, and damage to around 80 percent of all buildings. The Ava Bridge partially collapsed, and four out of five mosques in Sagaing City were destroyed. Historic temples in Chaung-U Township, in the resistance-held southwest of the region, were also damaged.\n\nIn Naypyidaw, the capital, 204 fatalities were confirmed, including many civil servants killed when their residential buildings collapsed. The air traffic control tower at Naypyidaw International Airport collapsed, killing six people. The city experienced road damage, ceiling collapses, and structural failure in several government buildings, including the military headquarters and parliament facilities. The permanent secretary of the labor ministry and several senior foreign officials were among the casualties. The Defence Services Museum and the National Museum sustained significant damage. In Pyinmana, 86 bodies were recovered from the ruins of monasteries and residential structures.\n\nIn Shan State, at least 60 deaths were reported in Nyaungshwe Township, particularly in villages near Inle Lake. The village of Kayla, with over 1 000 households, saw 75 percent of its buildings destroyed. Significant damage was also reported in Zarat Gyi and Seong Wa Gyi. Many deaths were attributed to structural collapses or electrocution. In Aungban, a hotel collapse resulted in two deaths and 20 people trapped, while 16 others were injured. During the earthquake, jet fighters en route to a bombing campaign dropped ordnance on Nawnghkio Township, exacerbating the destruction.\n\nIn Bago Region, Taungoo Township reported the deaths of five children in a collapsed school and 14 fatalities in a mosque. A shelter used by displaced persons collapsed, trapping more than 20 people. In Pyu, a family of four died when their home’s wall collapsed.\n\nIn Yangon, the damage was relatively limited. Some buildings tilted, and there were temporary disruptions to phone lines, but no major casualties were reported. Overall, the full scale of the disaster remains unclear, particularly in rural areas where access remains limited.\n\nIn Thailand, at least 10 people were killed, 68 were injured, and 90 were reported missing.\n\nIn Bangkok, building swaying led to mass evacuations. All rapid transit lines were suspended for a day, and trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand was halted. Shaking was also felt in Chiang Mai and across most of the country.\n\nIn Bangkok’s Chatuchak district, a 30-storey government office building under construction collapsed, killing at least 8 people and trapping 79 people under rubble. Another collapse occurred at a luxury condominium construction site where a skybridge fell while hundreds of workers were inside the buildings. The full extent of casualties at that site remains unclear.\n\nThe reason why Thailand was affected so much lies in its soft marine clay top layer amplifying long-period ground motion, which can match the resonant frequency of tall buildings.\n\nHigh-rise building collapses due to strong 7.7M earthquake in Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/ZZUmvyQYWy — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nMoment of the 7.7 Magnitude powerful earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/KOLTBVS4ES — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nUpdates\n\n09:33 UTC, March 31\n\nThe death toll has jumped to more than 2 900 in Myanmar and to 18 in Thailand.

The full extent of casualties at that site remains unclear.\n\nThe reason why Thailand was affected so much lies in its soft marine clay top layer amplifying long-period ground motion, which can match the resonant frequency of tall buildings.\n\nHigh-rise building collapses due to strong 7.7M earthquake in Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/ZZUmvyQYWy — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nMoment of the 7.7 Magnitude powerful earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/KOLTBVS4ES — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nUpdates\n\n09:33 UTC, March 31\n\nThe death toll has jumped to more than 2 900 in Myanmar and to 18 in Thailand.

        "content": "An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has hit central Myanmar, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has said, with Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, among other areas affected. We take a look at the origins of the event and the scale of the disaster.\n\nWhat happened? According to the USGS, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Mandalay, Myanmar at 6.21am GMT. The quake is thought to have been shallow, arising at a depth of just 10km (6 miles), but the damage is expected to be enormous, with multiple buildings collapsed or damaged and reports of roads buckled and broken. The death toll is climbing, with fatalities reported in both Myanmar and Thailand. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said: “It is highly likely that build quality will generally not be high enough to survive this level of shaking, and casualty numbers will almost certainly climb significantly as more becomes known of the scale of the disaster.”\n\nWhat caused the earthquake? Earthquakes arise when huge slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, move against each other. According to USGS, the Myanmar quake occurred as the result of “strike slip faulting” between the India and Eurasia plates – meaning that these two tectonic plates rubbed sideways against each other. Map showing areas affected by earthquake “The quake happened on the Sagaing fault, which marks the tectonic plate boundary between the Indian plate to the west and the Eurasian plate to the east. The Indian plate is moving north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate,” said McGuire. The USGS says the region has experience several similar large strike slip earthquakes in the past, with six occurring within about 250km of the current earthquake since 1900 that were magnitude 7 or greater.\n\nWhat do these magnitude figures mean? While many people have heard of the Richter scale to measure the size of an earthquake, the current standard is the moment magnitude scale. “The Richter scale is an old scale developed for California. It is only good for smaller quakes, and is not very good at differentiating the sizes of bigger shocks,” said McGuire. As the USGS website notes, the moment magnitude calculation is based on the strength of the rock where the slip occurred, the area of the fault that slipped, and the distance the fault moved. “Thus, stronger rock material, or a larger area, or more movement in an earthquake, will all contribute to produce a larger magnitude,” it adds. However, like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that as the magnitude increases by one unit, the degree of ground shaking involved increases 10-fold. “This is a major quake by any standard, and its impact is made far worse by the fact that it was very shallow – only about 10km down. If it had been 100km deep, the impact would have been much smaller, so depth as well as size is critical,” said McGuire. But, he added, measurements do vary dependent on the locations of the seismic arrays used. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center the Myanmar earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China’s south-west Yunnan province.\n\nWill there be further quakes? “There has already been one large aftershock, and others can be expected in coming hours to days,” said McGuire. “These can bring down already weakened buildings and make the work of rescuers even more challenging.”",

The full extent of death, injury and destruction is not known yet — particularly in Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war, with information tightly controlled.\n\n**Earthquake news | Highlights:** A powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake and multiple aftershocks struck Myanmar on Friday, causing roads to buckle, buildings coming down and sending tremors as far as China, Thailand and parts of India as well. According to Myanmar's ruling junta chief, at least 144 people were killed and over 700 people were injured in the destruction caused by the earthquake, however, the toll was expected to go higher....Read More\n\nAcross bordering Thailand, ten people were confirmed dead, including many in the collapse of a skyscraper in near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, while 70 more were missing and believed trapped in the twisted metal and rubble of the under-construction building.\n\n**Myanmar earthquake | Key point**s\n\n– The 7.7 magnitude Myanmar earthquake's epicenter was located in Mandalay, at a depth of 10 kilometers, around 12:50 pm local time (0620 GMT), according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Multiple aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude.\n\n– Tremors were also felt throughout northern Thailand and down to Bangkok, where residents fled to the streets as buildings shook. Visuals shared on social media showed a building collapse in Bangkok’s Chatuchak district. Due to the tremors, some metro and light rail services were suspended in Thailand's Bangkok. Jolts of the Myanmar earthquake were also felt in Vietnam.\n\n– Tremors were also felt in China's southwest Yunnan province, with Beijing's quake agency reporting the jolt as a 7.9 magnitude earthquake.\n\n– Earthquakes are relatively common in Myanmar, where between 1930 and 1956, six strong quakes of 7.0 magnitude or higher struck near the Sagaing Fault, which runs north to south through the center of the country, according to the USGS.\n\n– Mild tremors were felt in West Bengal's Kolkata and Manipur's Imphal as well after the powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar. According to official sources cited by news agency PTI, there have been no reports of damage to property or loss of life in the city due to the tremor.\n\n## Earthquake news: Dozens dead in Myanmar, 10 in Thailand | Top points\n\nEarthquake news: The strong earthquake that struck Myanmar on Friday has resulted in at least 144 deaths and over 732 injuries, with the toll expected to rise as rescue operations continue. In neighboring Thailand, a high-rise under construction collapsed in Bangkok, leaving at least 10 dead.\n\n## Updates to this live blog have ended.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: 14 tremblers hit Myanmar after 7.7 magnitude quake\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: According to US Geological Survey (USGS) data, a total 15 earthquakes were recorded in Myanmar within 10 hours on Friday, starting with the massive 7,7 magnitude trembler that struck the country at 06:20:54 (UTC).\n\nThe most powerful aftershock was measured at Magnitude 6.7, occurring at 06:32:04 (UTC), according to USGS.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: India sends relief material to Myanmar\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: Approximately 15 tonnes of relief material is being sent to Myanmar on an IAF C 130 J aircraft from Hindon air force station. The relief material includes tents, sleeping bags, blankets, ready-to-eat meals, water purifiers, hygiene kits, solar lamps, generator sets, essential Medicines (Paracetamol, antibiotics, canula, syringes, gloves, cotton bandages, urine bags, etc), according to sources cited by news agency ANI.\n\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Magnitude 4.2 quake hits Afghanistan\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: A Magnitude 4.2 earthquake hit Afghanistan in the early hours of Saturday. According to the US Geological Survey, the epicentre of the earthquake was 24 km south-southeast of Jurm in Afghanistan, at a depth of 226.9 kilometres.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Myanmar’s military leader appeals for international aid\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: Myanmar’s military leader on Friday appealed for international aid to cater to the aftermath of the powerful earthquake that has killed at least 144 people, a toll the country expects will go up as rescue efforts continue.\n\nThe earthquake and multiple aftershock, also affected neighboring Thailand, China, and Vietnam.

        "content": "FLOODING from incessant rain caused by the recent depression in the Bay of Bengal has remained somewhat unchanged while the government’s disaster management and relief efforts are barely visible. Four of the five north-eastern rivers that were flowing above their danger marks further swelled, as the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre reported in its last cycle on June 3. It is likely that rain would continue and some areas will remain flooded in the north-east. The onrush of water from the upstream region in India into these rivers has forced several hundred families to move to safety, also to flood shelter centres. The death toll from the flash flood and landslide has, meanwhile, already reached 15. Road connectivity and economic activities in the flood-hit areas have been disrupted. It is concerning that the government’s role has so far been limited to observing the disaster situation and issuing warnings, especially when flash floods from heavy rain became a cause for concern in the recent past.\n\nPreventive efforts to minimise the loss of life and public suffering from heavy rainfall should have already been in place. That has not, however, been the case. In Sylhet, the government has opened flood shelters but was not prompt enough to relocate people living in areas at landslide risk. The death of four members of a family from landslides in Sylhet speaks of the government’s inaction. Emergency response to help to alleviate the sufferings of people is the need of the hour, but equally important it is to address the root cause of frequent flash flooding. Local leaders put the flash flood mainly down to the unplanned construction of roads and other infrastructure that, too, grabbing canals and blocking low-lying areas that could, otherwise, drain out floodwater. Such infrastructure also includes long stretches of rural roads that block water from receding. Coupled with this is the problem of waning capacity of the rivers and canals to deal with excess water flow coming from the upstream.\n\nIn this context, the government should immediately take steps to minimise the loss of life and public suffering in the north-eastern flood-affected areas. In doing so, it should take early steps to relocate people living in areas already identified as risky for landslides and arrange transport and shelter for people living in the worst-hit areas. More important, the government should ensure emergency food and cash aid for people directly affected by the flash flood and landslide from the heavy rainfall. It should also pull down road stretches and infrastructure that block the natural flow of floodwater and dredge the rivers to increase their capacity to flush out floodwater and collected rainwater.",

State Councilor Stephane Ganzer told Radio Television Suisse that 90% of the village was destroyed.\n\nThe Cantonal Police of Valais said a search and rescue operation was underway for the missing 64-year-old man, involving a drone with a thermal camera.\n\nGlaciers vulnerable to climate change\n\nSwitzerland's glaciers have been severely affected by climate change.\n\nIn the years 2022 and 2023, they melted just as much as they had in the decades from 1960 through 1990.\n\nMatthias Huss, head of the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland, pointed to the likely influence of climate change in loosening the rock mass in the permafrost zone, which triggered the glacier collapse and the subsequent landslide.\n\n\"Unexpected things happen at places that we have not seen for hundreds of years, most probably due to climate change,\" he told Reuters.\n\nSwiss glacier collapse partially destroys village of Blatten To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nConcerns rising over blocked river\n\nAuthorities have declared a state of emergency as they monitor the situation of the huge pile of glacier debris, stretching 2 kilometers (1.25 miles), blocking the Lonza River.\n\n\"There is a serious risk of an ice jam that could flood the valley below,\" Antoine Jacquod, a military security official, told the Keystone-ATS news agency. \"We're going to try to assess its dimensions.\"\n\nWith the area too unstable to be approached, authorities indicated that an assessment would be made during the late afternoon from the nearby village of Ferden.\n\nThe deluge of mud, ice and debris has blocked the Lonza River Image: Jean-Christophe Bott/KEYSTONE/dpa/picture alliance\n\nAs a precaution, 16 people were evacuated late Wednesday from two villages downstream from the disaster area.\n\nAn artificial dam has been emptied to receive the water pushed back by the wall of ice, earth and rubble. Were that water to overflow from the dam, authorities would need to consider evacuating the valley.\n\n\"The deposit ... is not very stable, and debris flow is possible within the deposit itself [which] makes any intervention in the disaster area impossible for the time being,\" cantonal authorities said. They added that there is risk on both sides of the valley.\n\nResidents shocked by scale of destruction\n\nMartin Henzen, a Blatten resident, told Reuters that he was still trying to process what had occurred and did not want to speak for others in the village. \"Most are calm,\" Henzen said, \"but they're obviously affected.\"\n\nHenzen said residents had been making preparations for some kind of natural disaster but \"not for this scenario,\" referring to the scale of destruction.\n\nOne man was reported missing after the landslide Image: Jean-Christophe Bott/KEYSTONE/dpa/picture alliance\n\nUp to 1 million cubic meters (35 million cubic feet) of water could accumulate daily as a result of the debris damming up the river, and the buildings that emerged intact from the landslide are now flooding.\n\nAuthorities have been airlifting livestock out of the area.\n\n\"Right now,\" said Jonas Jeitziner, an official in neighboring Wiler, \"the shock is so profound that one can't think about it yet.\"\n\nEdited by: Zac Crellin",

Officials in Nagaland and Tripura states also confirmed two deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghalaya’s Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma ordered emergency teams to stay vigilant, “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, he warned in a public statement.\n\nThe Indian Army launched a large-scale rescue effort in Manipur state, evacuating hundreds. “People have been shifted to safer places,” the army said. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.”\n\nThe downpour has continued for three straight days, and India’s weather agency has forecast more heavy rains in the region in the coming days as it issued a red alert for several northeastern districts.\n\nRivers across the region, including the Brahmaputra, which originates in the Himalayas and flows through India into Bangladesh, have breached their banks, submerging vast areas and cutting off access to many communities.\n\nFloods and landslides are common during India’s June-to-September monsoon season, which is vital for agriculture but often deadly. Dozens of people die each year as rainfall overwhelms fragile infrastructure across the world’s most populous country.\n\nLast month, Mumbai was deluged by rain nearly two weeks before its usual beginning, the earliest monsoon arrival in the capital city of the western state of Maharashtra in over two decades, according to meteorological officials.\n\nScientists say climate change is altering weather patterns across South Asia, but the precise effects on the monsoon system remain unclear.",

        "content": "The abandoned homes and razed lots along the meandering Troublesome Creek in rural eastern Kentucky is a constant reminder of the 2022 catastrophic floods that killed dozens of people and displaced thousands more.\n\nAmong the hardest hit was Fisty, a tiny community where eight homes, two shops and nine people including a woman who uses a wheelchair, her husband and two children, were swept away by the rising creek. Some residents dismissed cellphone alerts of potential flooding due to mistrust and warning fatigue, while for others it was already too late to escape. Landslides trapped the survivors and the deceased for several days.\n\nIn response, geologists from the University of Kentucky secured a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and raced around collecting perishable data in hope of better understanding the worst flooding event to hit the region in a generation.\n\nView image in fullscreen A landslide in Callaway, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nOn a recent morning in Fisty, Harold Baker sat smoking tobacco outside a new prefabricated home while his brother James worked on a car in a makeshift workshop. With no place else to go, the Baker family rebuilt the workshop on the same spot on Troublesome Creek with financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).\n\n“I feel depressed. Everyone else is gone now. The days are long. It feels very lonely when the storms come in,” said Baker, 55, whose four dogs drowned in 2022. With so few people left, the car repair business is way down, the road eerily quiet.\n\nSince the flood that took everything, Harold and James patrol the river every time it rains. The vigilance helped avert another catastrophe on Valentine’s Day after another so-called generational storm. No one died, but the trauma, like the river, came roaring back.\n\n“I thought we were going to lose everything again. It was scary,” said Baker.\n\nAt this spot in July 2022, geologist Ryan Thigpen found flood debris on top of two-storey buildings – 118in (3 metres) off the ground. The water mark on Harold’s new trailer shows the February flood hit 23in.\n\nTroublesome Creek is a 40-mile narrow tributary of the north fork of the Kentucky River, which, like many waterways across southern Appalachia, does not have a single gauge. Yet these rural mountain hollows are getting slammed over and over by catastrophic flooding – and landslides – as the climate crisis increases rainfall across the region and warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico turbocharge storms.\n\nTwo years after 45 people died in the 2022 floods, the scale of disaster grew with Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 230 people with almost half the deaths in Appalachia, after days of relentless rain turned calm streams into unstoppable torrents.\n\nAnother 23 people died during the February 2025 rains, then 24 more in April during a four-day storm that climate scientists found was made significantly more likely and more severe by the warming planet.\n\nView image in fullscreen James and Harold Baker in their tool shed in Fisty, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nThe extreme weather is making life unbearable and economically unviable for a chronically underserved region where coal was once king, and climate skepticism remains high. Yet little is known about flooding in the Appalachian region. It’s why the geologists – also called earth scientists – got involved.\n\n“This is where most people are going to die unless we create reliable warning systems and model future flood risks for mitigation and to help mountain communities plan for long-term resilience. Otherwise, these extreme flooding events could be the end of southern Appalachia,” said Thigpen.\n\nAmid accelerating climate breakdown, the urgency of the mission is clear. Yet this type of applied science could be derailed – or at least curtailed – by the unprecedented assault on science, scientists and federal agencies by Donald Trump and his billionaire donors.\n\nDanielle Baker, James’s wife, had her bags packed a week in advance of the February flood and was glued to local television weather reports, which, like the geologists, rely on meteorological forecasting by the taxpayer-funded National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nShe was “scared to death” watching the creek rise so high again. But this time, the entire family, including 11 dogs and several cats, evacuated to the church on the hill, where they waited 26 hours for the water to subside.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jason Dortch and Ryan Thigpen document the water line on a trailer from the 2025 flooding in Fisty, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\n“The people in this community are the best you could meet, but it’s a ghost town now. I didn’t want to rebuild so close to the creek, but we had nowhere else to go. Every time it rains, I can’t sleep,” she said, wiping away tears with her shirt.\n\nDanielle was unaware of Trump’s plans to dismantle Fema and slash funding from the NWS and NSF. “A lot of people here would not know what to do without Fema’s help. We need more information about the weather, better warnings, because the rains are getting worse,” she said.\n\nA day after the Guardian’s visit in mid-May, an NWS office in eastern Kentucky scrambled to cover the overnight forecast as severe storms moved through the region, triggering multiple tornadoes that eventually killed 28 people. Hundreds of staff have left the NWS in recent months, through a combination of layoffs and buyouts at the behest of Trump mega-donor Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).\n\nIt doesn’t matter if people don’t believe in climate change. It’s going to wallop them anyway … This is a new world of extremes and cascading hazards Ryan Thigpen, geologist\n\nYet statewide, two-thirds of Kentuckians voted for Trump last year, with his vote share closer to 80% in rural communities hit hard by extreme weather, where many still blame Barack Obama for coal mine closures.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if people don’t believe in climate change. It’s going to wallop them anyway. We need to think about watersheds differently. This is a new world of extremes and cascading hazards,” said Thigpen, the geologist.\n\nThe rapidly changing climate is rendering the concept of once-in-a-generation floods, which is mostly based on research by hydrologists going back a hundred years or so, increasingly obsolete. Geologists, on the other hand, look back 10,000 years, which could help better understand flooding patterns when the planet was warmer.\n\nThigpen is spearheading this close-knit group of earth scientists from the university’s hazards team based in Lexington. On a recent field trip, nerdy jokes and constant teasing helped keep the mood light, but the scientists are clearly affected by the devastation they have witnessed since 2022. The team has so far documented more than 3,000 landslides triggered by that single extreme rain event, and are still counting.\n\nView image in fullscreen University of Kentucky earth scientists at the base of a landslide in Callaway, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nThis work is part of a broader statewide push to increase climate resiliency and bolster economic growth using Kentucky-specific scientific research. Last year, the initiative got a major boost when the state secured $24m from the NSF for a five-year research project involving eight Kentucky institutions that has created dozens of science jobs and hundreds of new student opportunities.\n\nThe grant helped pay for high-tech equipment – drones, radars, sensors and computers – the team needs to collect data and build models to improve hazard prediction and create real-time warning systems.\n\nView image in fullscreen An active Lidar scan on the drone controller flown by Ryan Thigpen in Hazard, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nAfter major storms, the team measures water levels and analyzes the sediment deposits left behind to calculate the scale and velocity of the flooding, which in turn helps calibrate the model.\n\nThe models help better understand the impact of the topography and each community’s built and natural environment – important for future mitigation. In these parts, coal was extracted using mountaintop mine removal, which drastically altered the landscape. Mining – and redirected waterways – can affect the height of a flood, according to a recent study by PhD student Meredith Swallom.\n\nA paleo-flood project is also under way, and another PhD student, Luciano Cardone, will soon begin digging into a section of the Kentucky riverbank to collect layers of sediment that holds physical clues on the date, size and velocity of ancient floods. Cardone, who found one local missionary’s journal describing flooding in 1795, will provide a historical or geological perspective on catastrophic flooding in the region, which the team believe will help better predict future hazards under changing climatic conditions.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Lidar drone flying a geological survey near the Perry county public library in Hazard, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nAll this data is analyzed at the new lab located in the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) department, where super-powerful computers are positioned around a ceiling-to-floor black board, with a groovy lamp and artwork to get the creative mathematical juices flowing.\n\nSo far the team has developed one working flood risk model for a single section of the Kentucky River. This will serve as a template, as each watershed requires its own model so that the data is manageable, precise and useful.\n\nThis sort of applied science has the capacity to directly improve the lives of local people, including many Trump voters, as well as benefiting other mountainous flood-prone areas across the US and globally. But a flood warning system can only work if there is reliable meteorological forecasting going forward.\n\nThe floods have made this a ghost town. I doubt it will survive another one. If you mess with Mother Nature, you lose Thomas Hutton of Kentucky\n\nReports suggest NWS weather balloons, which assess storm risk by measuring wind speed, humidity, temperature and other conditions that satellites may not detect, have been canceled in recent weeks from Nebraska to Florida due to staff shortages. At the busiest time for storm predictions, deadly heatwaves and wildfires, weather service staffing is down by more than 10% and, for the first time in almost half a century, some forecasting offices no longer have 24/7 cover.\n\nTrump’s team is also threatening to slash $1.52bn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the weather service’s parent agency, which also monitors climate trends, manages coastal ecosystems and supports international shipping, among other things.\n\n“To build an effective and trusted warning system, we need hyper-local data, including accurate weather forecasts and a more robust network of gauges,” said Summer Brown, a senior lecturer at the University of Kentucky’s earth and environmental sciences department. “The thought of weakening our basic weather data is mind-boggling.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Summer Brown speaks with Doug Naselroad at Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company in Hindman, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nIt’s impossible not to worry about the cuts, especially as the grand plan is to create a southern Appalachian flood and hazard centre to better understand and prepare the entire region’s mountain communities for extreme weather and related hazards, including flash floods, landslides and tornadoes.\n\nFor this, the team is currently awaiting a multimillion-dollar grant decision from the NSF, in what until recently was a merit-based, peer-reviewed process at the federal agency. The NSF director resigned in April after orders from the White House to accept a 55% cut to the $9bn budget and fire half of the 1,700-person staff. Then, in an unprecedented move, a member of the governing body stepped down, lambasting Musk’s unqualified Doge team for interfering in grant decisions.\n\nThe days are long. It feels very lonely when the storms come in Harold Baker of Kentucky\n\nThe NSF is the principal federal investor in basic science and engineering, and the proposed cut will be devastating in the US and globally.\n\n“Rivers are different all over Appalachia, and if our research continues, we can build accurate flood and landslide models that help communities plan for storms in a changing climate,” said Jason Dortch, who set up the flood lab. “We’ve submitted lots of great grant proposals, and while that is out of our hands, we will continue to push forwarded however we can.”\n\n\n\nFleming-Neon is a former mining community in Letcher county with roughly 500 residents – a decline of almost 40% in the past two decades. The town was gutted by the 2022 storm, and only two businesses, a car repair shop and a florist, reopened. The launderette, pharmacy, dentist, clothing store and thrift shop were all abandoned.\n\nView image in fullscreen The front of a home damaged by a large landslide in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nRandall and Bonnie Kincer, a local couple who have been married for 53 years, run the flower shop from an old movie theater on Main Street, which doubles up as a dance studio for elementary school children. The place was rammed with 120in of muddy water in 2022. In February, it was 52in, and everything still reeks of mould.\n\nThe couple have been convinced by disinformation spread by conspiracy theorists that the recent catastrophic floods across the region, as well as Helene, were caused by inadequate river dredging and cloud seeding. The town’s sorry plight, according to the Kincers, is down to deliberate manipulation of the weather system paid for by mining companies to flood out the community in order to gain access to lithium. (There are no significant lithium deposits in the area.)\n\nBonnie, 74, is on the brink of giving up on the dance classes that she has taught since sophomore year, but not on Trump. “I have total confidence in President Trump. The [federal] cuts will be tough for a little while but there’s a lot of waste, so it will level out,” said Bonnie, who is angry about not qualifying for Fema assistance.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bonnie and Randall Kincer in the gymnasium at Busy B’s Country Gift Shop in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May 2025.\n\n“We used all our life savings fixing the studio. But I cannot shovel any more mud, not even for the kids. I am done. I have PTSD. We are scared to death,” she said, breaking down in tears several times.\n\nThe fear is understandable. On the slope facing the studio, a tiered retainer wall has been anchored into the hill to stabilize the earth and prevent an avalanche from destroying the town below.\n\nAnd at the edge of town, next to the power station on an old mine site, is a towering pile of black sludgy earth littered with lumps of shiny coal – the remnants of a massive landslide that happened as residents cleaned up after the February storm.\n\nThomas Hutton’s house was swamped with muddy water after the landslide blocked the creek, forcing it to temporarily change course towards a residential street. “The floods have made this a ghost town. I doubt it will survive another one. If you mess with Mother Nature, you lose,” said Hutton, 74, a retired miner.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thomas Sutton at his home near a landslide in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nThe geologists fly drones fitted with Lidar (light detection and ranging): a remote sensing technology that uses pulsed lasers to create high-resolution, 3D, color models of the Earth’s surface, and can shoot through trees and human-made structures to detect and monitor changes in terrain including landslides. The affordability and precision of the China-made Lidar has been a “game changer” for landslides, but prices have recently rocketed thanks to Trump’s tariff war.\n\nThe Lidar picked up fairly recent deforestation above the Fleming-Neon power plant, which likely further destabilized the earth. The team agrees that the landslide could keep moving, but without good soil data it’s impossible to know when.\n\nLast year’s NSF grant funded new soil and moisture sensors, as well as mini weather stations, which the landslide team is in the process of installing on 14 steep slopes in eastern Kentucky – the first time this has been done – including one opposite Hutton’s house.\n\nBack at the lab, the geologists will use the data the sensors send back every 15 minutes to create models – and eventually a website where residents and local emergency managers can see how the soil moisture is changing in real time. The goal is to warn communities when there is a high landslide risk based on the soil saturation – and rain forecast.\n\n“We have taken so many resources from these slopes. We need to understand them better,” said Sarah Johnson, a landslide expert. “We’re not sitting in an ivory tower making money from research. The work we do is about making communities safer.”",

        "content": "The Landslide Blog is written by Dave Petley, who is widely recognized as a world leader in the study and management of landslides.\n\nOn 28 April 2025, a major debris flow travelled down a channel from a major mountain, Vallunaraju, striking the communities lower down the slope. At least 100 houses were destroyed and two or three people were killed.\n\nI am not in a position to be able to say definitively how this event occurred. Christian Huggel from the University of Zurich has a LinkedIn post that provides some detail. This is a part of what he has posted:-\n\n“Summarizing some information on the recent glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) that occurred in the early morning of 28 April from one of the glacier lakes at the toe of Vallunaraju (5680 m asl) and badly impacted rural and urban parts of Huaraz in the Andes of Peru. According to videos taken by mountaineers the likely origin of the GLOF (or aluvión) is a rock slope failure into a lake in some 300 m distance of the glacier margin … The analysis suggests that the rock fall triggered an impact wave in the lake with a subsequent debris flow that rushed downvalley along the Casca river, damaged some 100 houses, destroyed about 15 buildings and road infrastructure, and unfortunately also claimed the lives of 2-3 persons. The glacier lake probably formed around the 1970’s as the glaciers of Vallunaraju receded.\n\n“Some lines of evidence suggest that there were rock fall events prior to the 28 April GLOF at this location, including pre-event slope failures likely the day before the disaster.”\n\nThis is a cloudy area, so at present I cannot access satellite imagery that shows the slopes affected by the landslide that initiated this event. However, Planet Labs has captured imagery on both 26 April 2025 (before the event) and 30 April 2025 (after the event) that provides some insights into the downstream consequences.\n\nLet’s start with the main channel higher in the slopes of Vallunaraju. This Planet Labs image shows the valley immediately below the steep slope from which this event originated. The marker is at [-9.44993, -77.45431]:-\n\nPlanet Labs image before the 28 April 2025 Glacial Outburst Flood (GLOF) / landslide at Vallunaraju in Peru.

Image copyright Planet Labs, used with permission. Image dated 30 April 2025.\n\nAnd here is a slider to compare the two images:-\n\nClearly, cloud is a major issue in the 30 April 2025 image, and we cannot see the main part of the slope itself, but at the foot of the steep slope extensive scour and erosion is evident, and there is substantial change in the channel below.\n\nThis has then led to major impacts in the channel downstream. This is a part of the 30 April 2025 image, with the channel running roughly east to west, with extensive evidence of the aftermath of the debris flow:-\n\nPlanet Labs image of the downstream impacts of the 28 April 2025 Glacial Outburst Flood (GLOF) / landslide at Vallunaraju in Peru.

        "content": "Evidence of landslide-flood interaction from DEM of Difference\n\nWe used a DEM of Difference (DoD) produced from pre and post flood LiDAR as detailed by ref. 14. Details of channel change analysis based on the DoD are given in the Methods. The first 7 km of the ~16 km study channel had little channel erosion (~1.4 m3/m) and an average widening rate of 5 m or just half of the average preflood channel width (9.94 m) and a width ratio (i.e. width after/before the flood) was 1.6 (Fig. 2). The valley floor remained largely undisturbed (also refer to37). From around 7 km downstream (i.e. entry point of landslide L2 in Fig. 2), channel erosion (~20.7 m3/m) was much greater and had an average widening of 28 m and a width ratio of 3.76. The flood almost fully occupied the valley floor and so widening was achieved mostly through removal of valley floor sediment, although with some potential evidence of bedrock erosion on outer bends of the channel (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 5). The most rapid transition occurs at 7 km downstream over the 3.5 km transition reach, where channel widening reached 67 m, width ratio reached 9.44, and erosion averaged 38 m3/m. This transition is not explained by peak flood stream power (Fig. 2), as estimated from radar-based rainfall data (see Methods), which increases gradually downstream but does not provide the trigger of the sudden increase in channel width ratio. Whilst channel confinement, calculated as the ratio of valley width to pre flood channel width, constrains channel widening beyond 7 km downstream (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3), there is little channel widening for the first 7 km of the channel despite relatively unconstrained channels (i.e., confinement ratio ≥310) along the entirety of the study channel. There are also no obvious variations in channel bank material or riparian vegetation that would explain this increase in channel widening. However, the sudden increase in channel erosion and widening does occur just downstream from three major lateral sediment inputs from two landslides (L1, L2 in Figs. 1C and 2) and a tributary, totaling ~105,000 m3. Further downstream increases in width ratio also correspond to large lateral sediment inputs, but we focus on explaining the largest peak highlighted in Fig. 2. We used a combination of field data and numerical modeling to investigate the potential mechanisms by which landslide-channel interactions may have resulted in the pattern of channel erosion observed. We tested the hypotheses that the pattern of channel erosion generated by the flood was amplified by (1) bulking of the flow by landslide and tributary sediment; (2) damming of the flow by landslide and tributary sediment, and subsequent failure of this dam resulting in an erosive flood surge similar to that observed in debris flows32.\n\nField evidence of landslide-flood interaction\n\nAs an initial test for sediment bulking or surging of the flow that may explain the sudden increase in channel erosion and widening, we calculated the ratio C (field-measured peak discharge/runoff-based peak discharge32). Flood flows can have a range of C values between 0 and 138. Due to conservation of mass, this ratio cannot exceed 1 in the absence of substantial sediment bulking or surge dynamics and can be used as a check on indirect measurements of flood discharge35. A value of C > 1 is diagnostic of bulking of the flow and a value of C > 2 is indicative of surging in the flow, that would provide initial support for hypotheses 1 and 2 respectively. We visited the reach of increased channel erosion in October 2016 and August 2017 to make indirect measurements of flood peak discharge (Q peak ) with which to compare our estimated runoff-based discharge (Q runoff ) (see Methods) and calculate the ratio C.\n\nWe used a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect pairs of highwater marks at 23 channel cross sections upstream and downstream from the transition reach (Fig. 1C) in 2016 and 2017 with a vertical and horizontal precision of 0.6 m and 0.4 m, respectively. We identified highwater marks from the 2013 flood based on debris lines on the channel banks and debris trapped in trees. These highwater marks were relatively undisturbed in the 3–4 years since the 2013 flood event given the absence of a larger flood event over this time period16. We used the highwater marks within ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, California) to extract cross sections from lidar data. Where there is deviation in highwater mark elevations between the left and right banks (i.e. resulting in different reconstructed water levels), we propagate this uncertainty into our estimation of peak discharge cross-section area (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Additionally, we calculated cross-section areas using both pre- and post-flood lidar to account for uncertain channel topography during the flood. We calculated peak discharge in m3 s-1 as\n\n$${Q}_{{peak}}={VA}$$ (1)\n\nwhere A is cross-section area in m2 and V is velocity in m s-1. Velocity was calculated using the critical flow method as:\n\n$$V=\\sqrt{{gR}}$$ (2)\n\nwhere R is hydraulic radius in m calculated as \\(R=\\frac{A}{P}\\), where P is wetted perimeter in m, g is acceleration due to gravity, and assuming critical flow (i.e., Froude number = 1). The critical flow method has been shown by35 to give values most representative of the average flow conditions during the flood from an ensemble of peak discharge estimation techniques, potentially due to smoothing of the channel bed by sediment infilling during the flood.\n\nAlthough Q runoff only slightly increases along the transition reach from about 217 to 218 m3/s, Q peak shows a rapid increase from 72 m3/s (±5 m3/s) to 468 m3/s (±190 m3/s) over the ~300 m downstream from L2 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the estimated runoff coefficient, C, also increases from 0.33 ( ± 0.02) to 2.15 ( ± 0.87), with values >2 diagnostic of surge type behavior as can occur in debris flows (Fig. 3C)32.\n\nFig. 3: Channel characteristics and flood discharge derived from field measurements and lidar data. A Channel slope along the transition reach shown in Fig. 2 showing a decrease in channel slope coinciding with modeled dam formation; (B) pre- and post-flood channel profiles in black and gray lines respectively and highwater marks (red and black open circles with error bars) collected at 23 cross sections showing wedge of sediment remaining after the flood downstream from L2; (C) Q peak calculated from high water marks together with lidar (Figs. S6 and S7 and Table S1) in red and black open circles with error bars and Q runoff modeled using rainfall data (dark blue line) and ratio of these (C) (lighter blue line with blue shading showing uncertainty). C > 1 is indicative of a dam burst event. Dark gray band shows location of modeled dam that formed around the point of entry of L2 (Fig. 4). Light gray band shows location of remnants of dam observed in the field (Supplementary Fig. 1). Full size image\n\nDownstream from the L2 landslide entry, a cobble and boulder rich bar is clearly visible in satellite photos (Supplementary Fig. 1) and was found to have a median grain size of 22 cm (Supplementary Fig. 4). The post-flood channel profile also shows this wedge of sediment (Fig. 3B). We used numerical modeling, detailed below and in Methods, to test the hypothesis that this bar is what remains of a dam that was formed and then removed during the flood (Hypothesis 2). The precise timing of landslides that could have caused a valley damming event is uncertain but previous modeling of landslides in the catchment (including L2) indicates landslides occurred shortly after storm rainfall peaked late in the evening on September 11, with landslides on south facing slopes (including L2) occurring late in the evening of September 11 and landslides on north facing slopes occurring in the early morning of September 1239. Witness accounts also record the first landslides happening at this time in neighboring catchments34,40.\n\nThe ratio C calculated based on our field observations supports hypothesis 2 of a dam failure event because the rapid jump in widening at a distinct channel location indicates that a surge of sediment and water similar to a debris flow would be needed to generate erosional widening over a short distance. A dam failure could explain the bank erosion by bulking the flow and generating a positive feedback on bank erosion and channel widening. This has been observed for other dam burst events19, and therefore the dam failure hypothesis may explain the observed profound channel widening of up to 67 m.\n\nMulti-phase modeling of landslide-flood interaction\n\nTo further test hypothesis 2 of a dam formation and failure event, we carried out numerical simulations with the computational model r.avaflow (v. 2.4)41 to simulate sediment delivery to the valley floor and its interactions with the fluid flow of North Saint Vrain Creek. The computational model r.avaflow is a freely available deterministic, multi-phase model, which is based on the principles of energy and momentum transfer between liquid and solid phases, extending the use of a Voellmy-type resistance model to multiple phases41,42. Furthermore, r.avaflow has been used to simulate a range of hydro-geomorphic process chains including rock avalanches43, transition of rock avalanches into debris flows44 to glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides into lakes45. For fluvial systems, r.avaflow has been validated for glacial debris flow mobility in mountainous river channels46, entrainment of sediment by debris flows in channels47, and channel changes from cascading rockslide-channelized debris flow42. Until recently, it has not been used to simulate landslide-flood interaction29, despite the likely role that sediment supply has in flood dynamics.\n\nFor the simulation input, we used the landslides mapped from the DoD for the solid phase and the discharge Q runoff for the fluid phase. Because the total simulation time is relatively small (900 s in total), the fluid hydrograph has been taken as a constant discharge, corresponding to the peak flow Q runoff . Because the landslides were mostly formed by coarse sediment (based on in situ observations after the event), the input sediment phase was considered only as coarse (i.e., friction-dominated for the model computations), whereas no input has been used for the fine phase (i.e., inclusive of viscous effects). Although large wood likely played a role in channel widening in this event14, r.avaflow currently does not include this component, but this could be considered in future versions of the model, particularly in the case of hyper-congested flows48. As detailed below, simulations support the formation and removal of a dam downstream of L2, lending support to hypothesis 2. However, it was necessary to perform the simulation in two stages due to a limitation of the model in the version used (2.4), where topography is not updated during the model simulation. In stage (1) dam formation is simulated related to triggering of landslides L1 and L2 and delivery of sediment to the channel and topography is updated to include the dam, and in stage (2) dam removal is simulated using updated topography from stage (1). Boundary conditions and flow hydrographs remain the same for both steps. In the model, landslides have been assumed to be released simultaneously. This had minor effects on the simulations because the delivery time to the valley bottom was different for each individual landslide, and all occurred within 30–45 s from the start of the simulation. Several sets of simulations have been conducted to explore the parameter space, including mobility and erosive parameters (such as drag coefficient and friction), as well as the hydrographs of the main channel and tributary (Supplementary Table 2). Because all parameters are physically based, we used values that are conventionally found in the literature or recommended by the r.avaflow manual49 depending on the type of event.\n\nFigure 4 shows the topographic change within the study area at the end of the simulations for both dam formation (first stage) (Fig. 4a) and dam removal (second stage) (Fig. 4b) superimposed on the observed post-event channel extent. Irrespective of the parameters used for the simulations, the model supports the formation of a large sediment dam in the channel downstream from L2, as well as another smaller dam upstream related to L1 (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, when the topography of the area is updated with the deposition (or erosion) heights from the first simulation stage, the second stage model runs (Fig. 4b) show that substantial erosion occurs, removing the large dam within the simulation time of 900 s. The bulk of the dam is eroded over a period of ~300 s and leads to the erosion and widening of the channel immediately downstream, due to bulking of the flow by sediment. After this time, changes to channel topography was, in comparison, negligible. The final simulated topographic change (Fig. 4c) corresponds well with the observed pattern of erosion from the DoD shown in Figs. 1c and 2. There are some discrepancies between the simulation and observations. For example, the simulated dam occurs closer to the toe of the landslide L2 than the remnants of the dam we observed in the field, which occur ~100 m downstream (Fig. 3). However, these are to be expected considering challenges in replicating spatially explicit two- and three-dimensional landscape evolution in fluvial morphodynamic models50.\n\nFig. 4: Results of simulations using r.avaflow. a formation of the sediment dam outlined by red polygon, (b) dam removal with updated topography, (c) the resulting topographic change after both simulations, (d) the results of the simulations with no landslide sediment delivery, highlighting the importance of landslide sediment delivery for simulating observed channel widening. The blue arrow indicates flow direction, whilst the dam extent was mapped for values of deposition ≥0.05 m. Pink polygons show landslides, blue polygon shows post-flood channel and green circles show highwater marks used for calculation of flood discharge (Q peak ) in Fig. 3. Full size image\n\nTo further test hypothesis 2 that the topographic change of the channel was caused by the formation and then removal of the sediment dam, we performed an additional simulation (Fig. 4d) without landslide sediment input, to evaluate whether the flood flow alone and the sediment it mobilized from upstream to downstream (i.e., not including landslide sediment input) could have caused the channel change. In this scenario, only limited erosion (i.e., <0.10 m) was observed in the main channel downstream from L2 and the extent was substantially smaller than the post-event observations.This is in contrast with the simulations inclusive of landslide input (Fig. 4c), in which the post-event channel extents were much more consistent with the observed changes. The simulated volume of erosion along the channel downstream of the sediment dam is only 518 m3 in the simulation without landslides, compared to 1779 m3 when landslides are included. We therefore conclude that a landslide-dam failure and rapid delivery of sediment best explains the observed geomorphic channel change during the flood. All the numerical simulations involving landslides qualitatively agree on the formation and removal of a dam, whereby the downstream channel widening resulted from bulking of the flow by sediment related to a removal of the debris dam. This lends support to both hypotheses 1 and 2, and the ability of the model to simulate geomorphic change during floods accounting for large lateral sediment supply supports hypothesis 3.",

        "summary": "A DEM of Difference (DoD) produced from pre and post-flood LiDAR revealed distinct channel changes. The first 7 km of the study channel showed minimal erosion and widening. From 7 km downstream, coinciding with three major lateral sediment inputs (~105,000 m3 total) from landslides L1, L2, and a tributary, channel erosion and widening significantly increased, with the most rapid transition (up to 67m widening) occurring in a 3.5 km reach. Researchers investigated if this pattern was amplified by (1) flow bulking from sediment or (2) damming by sediment and subsequent dam failure. Field measurements of highwater marks from the 2013 flood were collected using GPS in 2016 and 2017. Calculations showed runoff-based peak discharge (Qrunoff) increased slightly, but field-measured peak discharge (Qpeak) rapidly increased from 72 m3/s to 468 m3/s downstream from L2. The estimated runoff coefficient (C), the ratio of Qpeak to Qrunoff, increased from 0.33 to 2.15 downstream from L2, with values >2 diagnostic of surge-type behavior. A cobble and boulder rich sediment bar was observed downstream from L2. Numerical simulations using r.avaflow were performed in two stages. Stage 1 simulated landslides L1 and L2 delivering sediment, forming a large dam downstream from L2 and a smaller dam upstream from L1. Stage 2 simulated the removal of the large dam within 900 seconds, with bulk erosion occurring over ~300 seconds, causing immediate downstream channel erosion and widening due to flow bulking. The combined simulated topographic change aligned well with observed erosion patterns. A control simulation without landslide sediment input showed only limited erosion, confirming that landslide-dam failure and rapid sediment delivery best explain the observed geomorphic channel change. The simulations supported both hypotheses: dam formation and removal, and subsequent downstream channel widening from flow bulking by sediment."

        "content": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sending representatives to agencies across the federal government, four people familiar with the matter said, to begin preliminary interviews that will shape the tech executives’ enormous ambitions to tame Washington’s sprawling bureaucracy. In recent days, aides with the nongovernmental “Department of Government Efficiency” tied to President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have spoken with staffers at more than a dozen federal agencies, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. The agencies include the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, the people said.\n\nAt the same time, Musk and Ramaswamy have significantly stepped up hiring for their new entity, with more than 50 staffers already working out of the offices of SpaceX, Musk’s rocket-building company, in downtown Washington, two of the people said. DOGE aims to have a staff of close to 100 people in place by Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile much about DOGE remains unclear — including who is paying the salaries of these staffers or exactly how DOGE representatives work with the formal transition team — the agency outreach reflects intensifying efforts by Musk and Ramaswamy to propose what they say will be “drastic” cuts to federal spending and regulations. Even as the scale of their project grows, Musk and Ramaswamy are encountering a slew of obstacles, including reluctance among congressional Republicans to approve deep budget cuts and a skeptical career civil service.\n\nTwo government employees said remarks Musk and Ramaswamy have made about the civil service have made them wary of the entire DOGE effort. Longtime civil servants — some who have built their careers learning the intricacies of the federal bureaucracy — are an awkward fit with Silicon Valley’s fast-moving and disruptive culture. Many in Washington regard the tech entrepreneurs as arrogant or naive about the complexity of reining in government.\n\nThe U.S. presidential transition process traditionally involves teams from the incoming administration working with existing agency staff and officials on the transfer of power, including regular briefings. This year’s changeover is far smoother than it was four years ago, when the process was complicated by Trump’s refusal to recognize the results of the election. But the uncertain status of DOGE relative to the rest of the Trump transition team has raised new questions about who precisely is speaking for the incoming administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a potential nod to the myriad challenges facing DOGE, Musk has begun tempering certain promises in his bid to achieve sweeping reform by reinventing the federal bureaucracy, eliminating entire agencies, shrinking the federal workforce and slashing historic sums from the federal budget. In an interview Wednesday night at CES, the tech trade show in Las Vegas, he said DOGE may fall short of his initial aim to cut $2 trillion in federal spending.\n\n“I think we’ll try for $2 trillion. I think that’s like the best-case outcome,” he said. “But I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting $1 [trillion].”\n\nThe idea of a commission to cut waste and regulation, long discussed among conservatives, was taken up by Musk and Trump during last year’s presidential election. Musk put $277 million toward electing Trump and other Republicans in 2024, and Trump has made the billionaire one of his most powerful advisers. After the election, Trump named Musk and Ramaswamy as DOGE’s co-leaders, assigned to identify government waste that the White House Office of Management and Budget would try to cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a project named as a joking reference to a meme-based cryptocurrency, DOGE has taken numerous steps since the election to build a very real Washington operation. Over the past several weeks, DOGE has been deluged by applications that have poured in through direct messages on X, Musk’s social media site, where the group put out a public call for “super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.”\n\nThat led to swarms of applicants who sought to bring their experience and credentials to the attention of Musk or Ramaswamy. In a blog post, Vinay Hiremath, co-founder of the tech company Loom, described four “intense and intoxicating” weeks of DOGE-related work after he became involved.\n\nAlthough he ultimately decided not to relocate to Washington for a job with DOGE, Hiremath said he had been added to multiple groups on the encrypted messaging app Signal, where DOGE is conducting much of its initial work. Hiremath did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crowdsourced callouts were followed by postings for more specific roles: Just after Christmas, DOGE said it was looking for IT, HR and financial staffers for full-time, salaried positions. This week, it put out a request for software engineers and information security engineers for full-time roles, advising applicants to send over “a few bullet points demonstrating exceptional ability” along with their cellphone numbers. On X, some users have listed their IQ scores in replies to Musk and DOGE and said they included them in their applications.\n\nKey leadership roles have also fallen into place. Steve Davis, the Boring Company president who oversaw steep cost-cutting at Twitter (now X) after Musk bought it, is helping to oversee the entire effort, and deputies have been recruited to focus on narrower aspects of its agenda, such as legislation and regulation, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nEmil Michael, a former Uber executive, is one of the people overseeing the effort to cut regulations, according to one person familiar with the matter, also speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect matters not yet made public. Trump has announced the appointment of Katie Miller, press secretary and communications director for former vice president Mike Pence, to DOGE. Trump also said in December that Bill McGinley, the former White House Cabinet secretary whom he’d previously named as White House counsel, would serve instead as DOGE counsel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how DOGE will drive change. The White House budget request applies to spending in fiscal 2026, which doesn’t begin until Oct. 1. Spending for the rest of the current fiscal year is being hashed out on Capitol Hill by congressional Republicans who already have voted overwhelmingly to boost spending for the Defense Department — an agency DOGE has vowed to target.\n\nNumerous party officials, meanwhile, are quietly wary of approving big spending cuts at the same time they are working to extend the expiring provisions of Trump’s 2017 tax legislation, which would reduce revenue by trillions of dollars. And it’s not clear how much weight Musk’s star power will carry on Capitol Hill, where federal spending is often prized for its benefits to hometown constituents. The limits of Musk’s influence were revealed in late December when Congress revised a stopgap spending bill he criticized but passed separate legislation to implement many of the specific provisions he lambasted.\n\nAs Musk’s emissaries begin to make contact with federal officials, critical questions remain unresolved about the group’s authority and responsibilities. The two federal employees expressed confusion about what DOGE is assigned to do — including whether it has Trump’s full backing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Every administration has to establish a relationship with its career people, because it’s the career people who keep the government going,” said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. “I think this is an important foray, but given what they have stated, it will be difficult for some career individuals to be cooperative with the DOGE people, who are not elected and are more advisers than political appointees.”",

Cabrera, who worked as a lead on Trump’s 2020 re-election bid in Florida, represents the residents of Miami, Hialeah, Coral Gables and other neighborhoods within Miami-Dade County. Trump has taken issue with what he called “highly unfair” fees being charged for the use of the Panama Canal and told attendees of a Turning Point USA event in Phoenix the U.S. was being “ripped off.” The president-elect has also accused the Chinese military of illegally operating the Panama Canal, a pillar of maritime travel and trade.\n\n## Council Of Economic Advisers Chairman: Stephen Miran\n\nTrump tapped **Stephen Miran**, who served as a senior adviser for economic policy in the Treasury Department during Trump’s first term and is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute conservative think tank, to lead the three-member panel, though his appointment must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n## Ambassador To Italy: Tilman Fertitta\n\nTrump tapped **Tilman Fertitta**, owner of the Houston Rockets and the Texas-based restaurant and entertainment company Landry’s as ambassador to Italy. Fores estimates Fertitta, a longtime GOP donor, has a net worth of $10.4 billion.\n\n## Special Envoy To The United Kingdom: Mark Burnett\n\nTrump named** Mark Burnett** as his pick for special envoy to the U.K., noting Burnett’s career as a producer for shows like “Survivor,” “Shark Tank,” “The Voice” and Trump’s “The Apprentice” in announcing the choice. Burnett is the former chairman of MGM and a 13-time Emmy Award winner.\n\n## Administrator Of The Federal Railroad Administration: David Fink\n\nTrump tapped** David Fink**, whom the president-elect referred to as a fifth-generation railroader, to lead the Federal Railroad Administration. Fink is a former president of Pan Am Railways and the son of David Andrew Fink, who served as president of Guilford Transportation before it rebranded as Pan Am.\n\n## Head Of The Justice Department’s Office Of Legal Policy: Aaron Reitz\n\n**Aaron Reitz**, who serves as the chief of staff for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was nominated by Trump to serve as the head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Policy. Reitz will lead the office to advance Trump’s “law and order agenda,” the president-elect wrote on Truth Social. Reitz previously served as deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and reportedly wrote after President Joe Biden’s election win in 2020 they would “fight Joe Biden and the Democrats at every turn,” suggesting “everything they do is unconstitutional, illegal, bad for Texas and bad for America.”\n\n## Justice Department Chief Of Staff: Chad Mizelle\n\nTrump nominated **Chad Mizelle**, who served as general counsel and chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first administration, to serve as chief of staff at the Justice Department.\n\n## Ambassador To The Holy See: Brian Burch\n\nTrump announced **Brian Burch** as his pick for ambassador to the Holy See on Friday, praising him as “a devout Catholic, a father of nine, and President of CatholicVote,” a Catholic advocacy group.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Burch said he will work “to promote the dignity of all people and the common good” and thanked Trump for the role.\n\n## Ambassador To Bahamas: Herschel Walker\n\nTrump picked former football player **Herschel Walker **to serve as his ambassador to the Bahamas, a job that requires Senate confirmation. A Heisman-winning University of Georgia and NFL running back, Walker ran for a Georgia Senate seat in 2022. He scored the GOP nomination after securing Trump’s endorsement, but he narrowly lost the general election to incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, after a scandal-filled campaign in which Walker was accused of threatening his ex-wife and paying a woman to get an abortion despite his staunch opposition to the procedure (which he denied). Walker’s relationship with the president-elect goes back to at least the 1980s, when he played for the New Jersey Generals, a short-lived United States Football League team bought by Trump.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that her appointment would ensure that “the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.” The former news anchor and 2022 Arizona gubernatorial candidate has embraced Trump’s false claims about the 2020 elections being stolen. After losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs in the Governor’s race in 2022, she refused to concede and made multiple failed legal attempts to challenge the results.

Before his political career, Perdue served as a top executive at several companies including Reebok, Sara Lee and Dollar General, where he played a key role in outsourcing manufacturing to China, Hong Kong and other Asian countries.

Bisignano appears much lower on AFL-CIO's list of highest-paid CEOs for 2023, with a total pay of $27.9 million last year. Federal Election Commission filings show Bisignano’s wife, Tracy Bisignano, donated $924,600 to Trump’s campaign in October.\n\n## Small Business Administration Administrator: Kelly Loeffler\n\nFormer Sen. **Kelly Loefller, **R-Ga.,** **was nominated as administrator of the Small Business Administration by Trump, who said Loefller will crack down on “waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach” in her new role. The former senator fundraised for Trump ahead of the election, raising $7 million for his campaign this summer, according to CNN. As SBA administrator, Loefller will be in charge of overseeing billions of dollars worth of loans and disaster aid to small businesses. Loeffler’s run in the Senate was short-lived, as she filled in for a vacant seat left by former Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and served from 2020 to 2021, when she was defeated by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. Loeffler is the former CEO of a cryptocurrency platform known as Bakkt and is married to Jeffrey C. Sprecher, the longtime CEO of financial services firm Intercontinental Exchange and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n## Irs Commissioner: Billy Long\n\nTrump selected former Rep. **Billy Long**, R-Mo., as the Internal Revenue Service’s 51st commissioner, noting he has known the former congressman since 2011.

Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, during the George W. Bush administration. Atkins “recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump wrote Wednesday, nodding to the crypto community’s embrace of Atkins, who would succeed crypto skeptic Gary Gensler as SEC chief.\n\n## Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator: Chad Chronister Withdraws\n\nHillsborough County (Fla.) Sheriff **Chad Chronister** was Trump’s initial choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency, but Chronister posted to X that he decided to withdraw. The post was met with accounts celebrating the withdrawal and ridiculing past decisions. But, the following day Trump took credit for Chronister stepping down, saying on Truth Social Chronister “didn’t pull out, I pulled him out.” Trump said he did so “because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.” As sheriff, Chronister once arrested a pastor for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules in 2020. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., posted to X after the announcement, saying he’s “glad to see [Chronister] withdraw from consideration. Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution.”\n\n## Senior Counselor For Trade And Manufacturing: Peter Navarro\n\nTrump chose **Peter Navarro** for the top trade advisor role, announcing the appointment on Truth Social and writing that Navarro “was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it,” referencing Navarro’s conviction last year that made him the first person in history to serve a prison sentence for contempt of Congress.\n\n## Nasa Administrator: Jared Isaacman\n\nTrump tapped billionaire **Jared Isaacman**, founder and CEO of Shift4 payment processing firm, as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, calling him “an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut” in a Truth Social post.\n\n## Army Secretary: Daniel Driscoll\n\nTrump announced **Daniel Driscoll**, a senior advisor to Vice President-elect JD Vance, will serve as the senior Defense department civilian.

Patel held multiple roles in the first Trump administration, including helping lead the GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into the FBI’s probe of Russia’s links to Trump’s 2016 campaign. He served as chief of staff to former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during Trump’s final months in office, and Trump reportedly attempted to install him as deputy CIA or FBI director in his final months in office, but reversed course amid internal backlash. Patel has remained fiercely loyal to Trump since he left office and has vowed to help Trump seek retribution against his various political enemies. He has also called for an overhaul of the FBI, writing in his book that the agency “has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken,” according to excerpts cited by ABC News. Patel would replace FBI Director Christopher Wray if he’s confirmed by the Senate.\n\n## Ambassador To France: Charles Kushner\n\nTrump nominated **Charles Kushner**, founder of the real estate firm Kushner Companies and the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared, as U.S. ambassador to France.

In announcing the appointment, Trump said “Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease.” In 2020, Bhattacharya co-authored an open letter titled the “Great Barrington Declaration” which argued against the effectiveness of Covid-19 lockdowns. The letter, which was criticized by health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, argued for “herd immunity” for most of the population “through natural infection” while sheltering vulnerable populations. According to his profile page on Stanford Medicine, the India-born Bhattacharya serves as professor of health policy at the university.\n\n## United States Trade Representative: Jamieson Greer\n\nWashington lawyer **Jamieson Greer** is Trump’s pick to lead international trade negotiations.

Trump said Hassett “will play an important role in helping American families recover from the Inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration.” Hassett, who led the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s first term, recently expressed some skepticism about some of Trump’s economic proposals, telling Goldman Sachs last month Trump’s proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% was unlikely to net the same “dynamic effects” as the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and Trump’s tariffs proposals would likely require legislation, Politico reported. Hassett also told Goldman that Federal Reserve leadership should be “neutral” from the administration and said “suspicions” about Trump’s desire for coordination between the Fed and the White House in setting interest rates “should be taken seriously.”\n\n## Domestic Policy Council Director: Vince Haley\n\n**Vince Haley, **who served as adviser and speechwriter during Trump’s first term was named as the head of the Domestic Policy Council. Trump said Haley had a “brilliant mind for Policies that work for the American People.” Trump did not outline any specific issues that Haley will focus on, but according to the Wall Street Journal the council will oversee several key domestic issues, including “healthcare, immigration and education.” Haley has worked with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., for several decades and even served as the campaign manager of his 2012 presidential bid. Haley also worked under Stephen Miller—who Trump named as his Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy— while writing Trump’s speeches during his first term in office.\n\n## Department Of Health And Human Services Deputy Secretary: Jim O’neill\n\nSilicon Valley investor **Jim O’Neill**, who is a close associate of billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel, was named as the pick for the Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary. In his announcement Trump said O’Neill will work alongside his HHS Secretary pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and “oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again.” O’Neill previously served as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation and was up for consideration for the FDA commissioner role during Trump’s first term. O’Neill also worked as the HHS principal associate deputy secretary during the George W. Bush administration. The Silicon Valley investor has called for major reform at the FDA in the past and argued that the efficacy of drugs should be measured after they have been allowed on market. O’Neill said the agency should approve drugs once its been demonstrated as being safe.\n\n## Navy Secretary: John Phelan\n\nTrump tapped financier **John Phelan** as his nominee for Secretary of the Navy. Phelan founded MSD Capital more than two and half decades ago to manage the fortune of billionaire Michael Dell. According to the Hill, Phelan was a key donor to Trump’s campaign during this election season and contributed $834,600 to the president-elect’s joint fundraising committee, Trump 47.\n\n## Treasury Secretary: Scott Bessent\n\nHedge fund executive **Scott Bessent** is Trump’s pick for treasury secretary. Bessent—who spoke recently with Forbes—had long been seen as a top choice for the role, especially as it was reported Trump was leaning toward someone with Wall Street experience. Bessent is the founder of Key Square Management, a hedge fund that had less than $600 million in assets under management at the end of last year, and worked for Democratic megadonor George Soros for years before that. Bessent donated about $3 million to Trump and other Republican causes this election season and previously said Trump was “very sophisticated on economic policy.” Bessent is known for being pro-tariff—tariffs are at the center of Trump’s economic policies—and called the import taxes a “negotiating tool with our trading partners” in a Fox News column. If confirmed, Bessent would make history as the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ+ Republican Cabinet member.\n\n## Attorney General: Pam Bondi\n\nTrump announced former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his pick to lead the Justice Department—elevating an ally shortly after former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s withdrawal. Bondi served as Florida’s top lawyer from 2011 to 2019, and later joined Trump’s defense team in his first Senate impeachment trial in 2020. She also served on a Trump-era commission on opioids and drug addiction. Attorney general is one of the most high-profile and highly anticipated appointments, as Trump has fiercely criticized the Justice Department for prosecuting him and is expected to drastically change its makeup—and possibly push for retribution against his opponents. In a Truth Social post, Trump said Bondi will “refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.”\n\n## Secretary Of Defense: Pete Hegseth\n\nTrump selected **Pete Hegseth** as his secretary of defense, praising his status as a combat veteran and role as a co-host on Fox & Friends Weekend. Revelations subsequently emerged that Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. The Monterey Police Department confirmed in a statement that it investigated the incident, but did not bring charges. Hegseth has denied the allegations through his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, who told multiple outlets he paid his accuser a settlement to avoid a lawsuit over the matter.\n\n## Health And Human Services Secretary: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump nominated **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** to lead the Health and Human Services Department, making good on his promise to give Kennedy broad leeway over public health. Kennedy, who ran for the Democratic nomination then as an independent candidate before dropping out and endorsing Trump, espouses debunked views on public health—including skepticism about the efficacy of childhood vaccines and the Covid-19 vaccine. He has also advocated for removing fluoride from public water, an idea Trump said he as open to. As HHS secretary, Kennedy would oversee 13 public health-related agencies, and has expressed plans to upend many of them, telling an audience at a conference in November he would halt infectious disease studies at the National Institutes of Health if given a role in the Trump administration. “I’m going to say to NIH scientists, God bless you all . . . thank you for your public service,” NBC reported. The surprise selection drew criticism from many Democrats, and some Republicans expressed wariness about the pick. Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence spoke against Kennedy as the pick to lead HHS in a statement and urged Senate Republicans to reject the nomination, citing Kennedy’s support of abortion rights.\n\n## Secretary Of State: Marco Rubio\n\nTrump nominated Sen. **Marco Rubio**, R-Fla., as secretary of state. Rubio and Trump feuded when they both ran for president in 2016, but the two smoothed over their relationship during Trump’s most recent White House run. Rubio frequently campaigned for Trump and was said to be in the running to be his vice presidential pick. Some of Rubio’s foreign policy stances break with Trump, including his co-sponsorship of legislation last year that would prohibit a president from exiting NATO without congressional approval. Rubio would be the first Latino to hold the position, which is subject to Senate confirmation. Forbes estimated Rubio’s net worth at over $1 million—significantly less than some other members of Trump’s inner circle, but a jump since 2015, when he was worth just $100,000.\n\n## Director Of National Intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard\n\nTrump announced **Tulsi Gabbard** will serve as his Director of National Intelligence, a role that puts her at the head of the U.S. intelligence community. Gabbard is a former Democratic representative from Hawaii and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, perhaps best-known for clashing with Kamala Harris on the debate stage in 2019. She left the party in 2022 and became an independent, before endorsing Trump in August and announcing she had joined the Republican Party. A critic of U.S. military interventions, Gabbard has drawn intense scrutiny for her foreign policy views, including for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017.\n\n## Education Secretary: Linda Mcmahon\n\nTrump tapped former WWE CEO **Linda McMahon** as secretary of the Department of Education. McMahon is Trump’s transition co-chair alongside Lutnick and served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. The nomination came after Lutnick was picked as commerce secretary over McMahon, who was “privately frustrated” she was not offered the position before Lutnick was tapped for it, Semafor reported, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. McMahon is also the America First Policy Institute’s board chair, helping lead the think tank that has raised millions in support of Trump, according to CNN.\n\n## Commerce Secretary: Howard Lutnick\n\n**Howard Lutnick** is Trump’s pick for commerce secretary—choosing him for the commerce role instead of treasury secretary. Trump, in a statement, called Lutnick “the embodiment of resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy,” referencing his charitable contributions to 9/11 families after 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees, including Lutnick’s brother, died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while Lutnick was CEO. Lutnick, who rebuilt the company after 9/11, has spent his entire career at Cantor Fitzgerald and became president and CEO of the financial services firm at the age of 29. His special purposes acquisition company, Cantor Fitzgerald Acquisition Corp., took the Rumble video platform popular among right-wing influencers public in 2022. As commerce secretary, Lutnick will play a role in implementing Trump’s plans for steeper tariffs and he has expressed broad support for the proposal. Lutnick was previously under consideration for treasury secretary—typically a more prominent Cabinet job—and earned support from Musk and Kennedy, but Trump ultimately turned his attention to other candidates after he reportedly became annoyed with Lutnick’s aggressive campaign for the treasury role.\n\n## Homeland Security Secretary: Kristi Noem\n\nTrump picked South Dakota Gov. **Kristi Noem** for the role of secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem is a long-time Trump loyalist who was believed be a contender for Vice President. The appointee will be essential in carrying out Trump’s aggressive immigration plans, in addition to the agency’s duties surrounding cybersecurity, antiterrorism and emergency response.\n\n## Agriculture Secretary: Brooke Rollins\n\nTrump announced **Brooke Rollins **as his pick for agriculture secretary. Rollins served as a policy advisor during Trump’s first administration and is the president of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank founded by former Trump administration officials that has advocated against foreign ownership of U.S. farmland. She was reportedly considered for White House chief of staff before Susie Wiles was named to the role.\n\n## Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services Administrator: Mehmet Oz\n\n**Mehmet Oz**, the celebrity doctor who lost his 2022 Senate bid to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., will fill the role. Oz will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump announced as his pick for Health and Human Services secretary. Oz’s rise to fame is largely tied to his frequent appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show in the early 2000s and his own subsequent daytime talk show. He’s accused of espousing questionable medical claims, including promoting the debunked theory that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19, and pushing so-called miracle weight loss products unsupported by scientific research. Trump endorsed Oz in his 2022 Senate campaign.\n\n## Chief Of Staff: Susie Wiles\n\nTrump named his campaign co-manager **Susie Wiles** chief of staff two days after his election win, marking his first major administrative pick. Wiles will be the first woman to hold the position.\n\n## Department Of Government Efficiency: Elon Musk And Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nTrump announced **Elon Musk**, the world’s wealthiest person, will run a new Department of Government Efficiency (or “DOGE”) alongside investor and former Republican primary candidate **Vivek Ramaswamy**. Trump said in a statement the department—which has not yet been created—will offer “advice and guidance from outside of Government” and focus on “making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency,” including through spending and regulatory cuts. Musk, a vocal Trump backer who donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, has pitched the department in the past, seemingly naming it after the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin.\n\n## Office Of Management And Budget Director: Russell Vought\n\nTrump nominated **Russell Vought** as director of the Office of Budget and Management, potentially marking his second time in the role. Vought was the office’s director from 2020 to 2021 after serving as deputy director and acting director. Vought authored a chapter in the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda on the Executive Office of the President of the United States and will be in charge of overseeing the White House budget and implementation of Trump’s policies throughout the executive branch. He also reportedly said in secret camera footage published by the Centre for Climate Reporting that Trump “blessed” Project 2025 despite distancing himself from it on the campaign trail. Vought is expected to push for policy restructuring that provides more power to the president.\n\n## Homeland Security Adviser And Deputy Chief Of Staff For Policy: Stephen Miller\n\nTrump announced **Stephen Miller **as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, plus the additional role of homeland security adviser. Miller was a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and one of the architects of some of his most controversial immigration policies, including his family separation program.\n\n## Border Czar: Tom Homan\n\nTrump appointed his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director **Tom Homan** to newly created role, he announced, as Trump plans a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his second term.\n\n## Cdc Director: Dave Weldon, Fda Commissioner: Marty Makary, Surgeon General: Janette Nesheiwat\n\nTrump announced former Rep. **Dave Weldon**, R-Fla.—who served in Congress from 1995 to 2009—as CDC director, and tapped **Marty Makary**, who became known for opposing vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, as FDA commissioner. He also named former Fox News contributor **Janette Nesheiwat** as his pick for surgeon general.\n\n## Secretary Of Labor: Lori Chavez-Deremer\n\nRep. **Lori Chavez-DeRemer**, R-Ore., was nominated as Trump’s secretary of labor. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 to represent Oregon’s 5th Congressional District and recently lost her reelection bid.\n\n## Senior Director For Counterterrorism: Sebastian Gorka\n\n**Sebastian Gorka** was appointed as the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism.

Turner served in the first Trump administration as the executive director of Trump’s White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.\n\n## National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz\n\nTrump appointed Rep. **Mike Waltz**, R-Fla., to serve as his national security adviser. In recent months, Waltz—a former Army Green Beret—has frequently criticized China, urged NATO members to pay more for defense and said he expects Trump to push Ukraine and Russia toward a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n## Interior Secretary: Doug Burgum (and Head Of New National Energy Council)\n\nTrump nominated North Dakota Gov. **Doug Burgum** as secretary of the interior. If confirmed by the Senate, he’ll be responsible for managing vast swaths of federally owned land, administering national parks and handling oil and gas drilling on federal property—which Trump has vowed to ramp up. Trump also tapped Burgum as chairman of the new National Energy Council, which will cut down on regulations and “oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE,” according to Trump. The position will also provide Burgum a seat on the National Security Council. First elected North Dakota governor in 2016, Burgum briefly ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries, but dropped out and endorsed Trump. A tech executive and investor by trade, Burgum previously ran Great Plains Software, remaining at the company after it was acquired by Microsoft. Last year, Forbes estimated his net worth at at least $100 million.\n\n## Energy Secretary: Chris Wright\n\n**Chris Wright**, chief executive of the oilfield services group Liberty Energy, was named Trump’s nominee for secretary of energy. Wright has argued against climate change’s role in causing extreme weather events, saying in a video posted to LinkedIn last year “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” He later disputed he was “[fighting] climate science,” despite saying the claims he made were “correct.”\n\n## Transportation Secretary: Sean Duffy\n\nTrump nominated former Rep. **Sean Duffy**, R-Wisc., as secretary of transportation, lauding his time in Congress and his role as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Following his resignation from Congress in 2019, Duffy registered as a lobbyist and continued spending campaign funds on Trump’s D.C. hotel. The campaign spent more than $22,000 at Trump’s D.C. hotel between 2017 and 2020, $17,000 of which was spent in a single day in July 2019. Duffy is a co-host of Fox Business’ “The Bottom Line” and has contributed to Fox News since 2020. He is married to “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\n## Veterans Affairs Secretary: Doug Collins\n\nTrump picked former Rep. **Doug Collins**, R-Ga., as his secretary for veterans affairs. Collins served as a congressman from 2013 to 2021, and was known as a vocal backer of Trump in the chamber during his first administration. He is also a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command. Collins vowed to “streamline and cut regulations in the VA, root out corruption, and ensure every veteran receives the benefits they've earned.” The former congressman was deployed to Iraq in 2008 as a member of the Air Force’s 94th Airlift Wing.\n\n## Cia Director: John Ratlciffe\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence **John Ratcliffe** will serve as CIA director. A former Texas congressman, Ratcliffe served as the director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021 and acted as Trump’s primary intelligence adviser during his last presidency. During his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe declassified unverified Russian intelligence information that claimed Hillary Clinton approved a plan to link Trump to Russia and the Democratic National Committee cyberattacks in 2016. Democrats criticized Ratcliffe’s decision to publicly release the information, alleging he was politicizing unverified information to aid Trump.\n\n## Environmental Protection Agency Administrator: Lee Zeldin\n\nTrump tapped former Rep. **Lee Zeldin**, R-N.Y., to lead the EPA, citing his “very strong legal background” and calling him “a true fighter for America First policies” in a statement. Zeldin—a Trump ally who ran for New York governor two years ago—“will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American business while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards,” the statement said.\n\n## Fcc Chair: Brendan Carr\n\nTrump named **Brendan Carr** to chair the Federal Communications Commission. Carr has served as one of the FCC’s five commissioners since 2017, when Trump first appointed him to the agency. He’s known as a critic of big tech companies, writing a chapter of the controversial Project 2025 agenda—which Trump has broadly disavowed—that argued the FCC should narrow the immunity enjoyed by tech platforms and require companies to be transparent about their content moderation decisions. He’s also used his platform at the FCC to back Musk. He’ll take over the FCC as Trump pushes the agency to revoke the licenses of broadcast TV stations whose coverage he claims is unfair—though that could be very difficult in practice.\n\n## Ambassador To Un: Elise Stefanik\n\nTrump nominated GOP Conference Chair Rep. **Elise Stefanik**, R-N.Y., for the United Nations ambassador role. Stefanik is known as a staunch Trump ally.\n\n## Special Envoy To The Middle East: Steven C. Witkoff\n\nTrump tapped** Steven Witkoff**, a GOP donor and real estate investor, for special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is chairman of the University of Miami Business School Real Estate Advisory Board and the CEO of Witkoff, a real estate firm he founded in 1997. He is also a longtime friend of Trump’s and one of the president-elect’s golf partners. Witkoff was with Trump during the apparent second assassination attempt on his life, telling NBC that Secret Service agents dived on Trump and got him off his Florida golf course in under 20 seconds.\n\n## Ambassador To Nato: Matthew Whitaker\n\nTrump announced **Matthew Whitaker** will serve as the official U.S. representative to NATO. Whitaker was the former U.S. acting attorney general appointed after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned and before former Attorney General William Barr was sworn in during Trump’s first term. Whitaker oversaw the DOJ during former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was heavily scrutinized by Democrats over whether he sought to interfere in the probe on Trump’s behalf, allegations he denied. Whitaker frequently appears on Fox News as an advocate for Trump, defending his decision to tap Gaetz as attorney general and broadly criticizing the Justice Department over its various investigations into Trump’s conduct.\n\n## Ambassador To Israel: Mike Huckabee\n\nTrump announced former Arkansas Gov. **Mike Huckabee** as his envoy to Israel, touting his military service as he served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years. Huckabee is a staunch supporter of Israel and has criticized the Biden administration’s calls for a cease-fire with Hamas. Huckabee has advocated for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank, which Israel occupied in 1967, and has backed Israeli settlers in the territory. A former Southern Baptist pastor, Huckabee regularly leads evangelicals on visits to Israel.\n\n## White House Press Secretary: Karoline Leavitt\n\n**Karoline Leavitt**, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, will serve as White House Press Secretary once the president-elect assumes his office. Leavitt, 27, was an assistant press secretary during Trump’s first presidency. She also won the Republican primary in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in 2022, becoming the second Gen Z candidate to win a House primary.\n\n## White House Communications Director: Steven Cheung\n\nTrump picked his campaign spokesman, **Steven Cheung**, to serve as his communications director at the White House.

JD Vance’s lead policy staffer and worked in the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term. **Matt Brasseaux**, a deputy political director for the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee in 2024, was appointed director of the office of political affairs.**Alex Latcham**, Trump’s former deputy political director during his first administration and a senior deputy political director for his most recent campaign and the RNC, will serve as director of the office of public liaison.- Campaign staffer and former One America News anchor\n**Natalie Harp**—nicknamed the “human printer” as she’s known for trailing Trump with a portable printer and supplying him with paper copies of news stories—is expected to help control the flow of information to and from Trump, according to The New York Times, though she hasn’t officially been given a role. - Top GOP lawyer\n**William McGinley**was chosen for White House counsel, after previously working as Trump’s White House cabinet secretary from 2017 to 2019, advising other cabinet members on policy coordination, optics and ethics. **Dan Scavino**will return to his role as deputy chief of staff, after serving as a longtime Trump communications staffer (he was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in the House Jan. 6 committee investigation, but the Justice Department declined to prosecute him).**James Blair**will work as deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs, after spearheading Trump’s grassroots voter outreach efforts and making frequent media appearances.**Taylor Budowich**was picked for deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, after running the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. super PAC.- Trump tapped\n**William Scharf**to be White House staff secretary: Scharf, a former prosecutor who ran in the Republican primary for Missouri attorney general, was part of Trump’s legal team that successfully argued he has immunity from official acts he took during his first term. **Sergio Gor**, president and co-founder of Donald Trump Jr.’s Winning Team Publishing company, has been tapped to lead the Presidential Personnel Office.\n\n## Other Justice Department Jobs\n\n**Joseph Nocella Jr.**, a Nassau County District Court Judge, was tapped as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, one of the most high-profile districts in the country spanning Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Long Island. Nocella will replace Biden appointee Breon Peace, who is stepping down later this month.**Todd Blanche**, Trump’s hush money trial lawyer, was tapped as the president-elect’s deputy attorney general. Blanche was lauded as “an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department,” which Trump has often criticized throughout his criminal and civil cases.- Trump picked another of his attorneys,\n**Emil Bove**, as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove represented Trump alongside Blanche throughout the hush money trial and is a former federal prosecutor. **Dean John Sauer**was chosen for for solicitor general, after he was credited with helping win Trump’s presidential immunity case, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have some immunity for official acts they take in office. Sauer also served as solicitor general of Missouri for six years and clerked for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman\n**Jay Clayton**was chosen as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, widely seen as one of the most prestigious prosecuting jobs due to the high-profile cases filed in the district, which includes New York City.\n\n## Tangent\n\nTrump asked Republican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley to return to his role. Trump tapped Whatley and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to co-chair the RNC after he effectively secured the GOP 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n## Key Background\n\nTrump decamped to Mar-a-Lago after his win, holding meetings with his inner circle, administration hopefuls and transition team to craft his second term agenda and build out his staff. Trump is shaping his second-term agenda with the help of several right-wing groups, his closest allies and billionaire backers. Musk, who has been spotted on numerous occasions alongside Trump since his election, is among those who appear to be influencing Trump’s policy and personnel decisions. Lutnick is also overseeing a team making recommendations for personnel picks and vetting potential candidates, and Miller is expected to play a key role in making the final decisions. The right-wing think tank America First Policy Institute is reportedly the primary driver of Trump’s transition plans and has been crafting possible executive actions for Trump once he takes office. The organization is chaired by McMahon and led by former Trump Domestic Policy Counsel Director Brook Rollins.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nWho Will Help Shape Trump’s Policy Agenda?

Brandon Bell | Via Reuters\n\nThe U.S. political landscape is set to undergo some shifts in 2025 — and those changes will have some major implications for the regulation of artificial intelligence. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Joining him in the White House will be a raft of top advisors from the world of business — including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — who are expected to influence policy thinking around nascent technologies such as AI and cryptocurrencies. Across the Atlantic, a tale of two jurisdictions has emerged, with the U.K. and European Union diverging in regulatory thinking. While the EU has taken more of a heavy hand with the Silicon Valley giants behind the most powerful AI systems, Britain has adopted a more light-touch approach. In 2025, the state of AI regulation globally could be in for a major overhaul. CNBC takes a look at some of the key developments to watch — from the evolution of the EU's landmark AI Act to what a Trump administration could do for the U.S.\n\nMusk's U.S. policy influence\n\nElon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on the day of a meeting with Senate Republican Leader-elect John Thune (R-SD), in Washington, U.S. December 5, 2024. Benoit Tessier | Reuters\n\nAlthough it's not an issue that featured very heavily during Trump's election campaign, artificial intelligence is expected to be one of the key sectors set to benefit from the next U.S. administration. For one, Trump appointed Musk, CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla , to co-lead his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" alongside Ramaswamy, an American biotech entrepreneur who dropped out of the 2024 presidential election race to back Trump. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, told CNBC Trump's close relationship with Musk could put the U.S. in a good position when it comes to AI, citing the billionaire's experience as a co-founder of OpenAI and CEO of xAI, his own AI lab, as positive indicators. \"We've finally got one person in the U.S. administration who truly knows about AI and has an opinion about it,\" Calkins said in an interview last month. Musk was one of Trump's most prominent endorsers in the business community, even appearing at some of his campaign rallies.\n\nThere is currently no confirmation on what Trump has planned in terms of possible presidential directives or executive orders. But Calkins thinks it's likely Musk will look to suggest guardrails to ensure AI development doesn't endanger civilization — a risk he's warned about multiple times in the past. \"He has an unquestioned reluctance to allow AI to cause catastrophic human outcomes – he's definitely worried about that, he was talking about it long before he had a policy position,\" Calkins told CNBC. Currently, there is no comprehensive federal AI legislation in the U.S. Rather, there's been a patchwork of regulatory frameworks at the state and local level, with numerous AI bills introduced across 45 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe European Union is so far the only jurisdiction globally to drive forward comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence with its AI Act. Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe European Union has so far been the only jurisdiction globally to push forward with comprehensive statutory rules for the AI industry. Earlier this year, the bloc's AI Act — a first-of-its-kind AI regulatory framework — officially entered into force. The law isn't yet fully in force yet, but it's already causing tension among large U.S. tech companies, who are concerned that some aspects of the regulation are too strict and may quash innovation. In December, the EU AI Office, a newly created body overseeing models under the AI Act, published a second-draft code of practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, which refers to systems like OpenAI's GPT family of large language models, or LLMs. The second draft included exemptions for providers of certain open-source AI models. Such models are typically available to the public to allow developers to build their own custom versions. It also includes a requirement for developers of \"systemic\" GPAI models to undergo rigorous risk assessments. The Computer & Communications Industry Association — whose members include Amazon , Google and Meta — warned it \"contains measures going far beyond the Act's agreed scope, such as far-reaching copyright measures.\" The AI Office wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It's worth noting the EU AI Act is far from reaching full implementation. As Shelley McKinley, chief legal officer of popular code repository platform GitHub, told CNBC in November, \"the next phase of the work has started, which may mean there's more ahead of us than there is behind us at this point.\" For example, in February, the first provisions of the Act will become enforceable. These provisions cover \"high-risk\" AI applications such as remote biometric identification, loan decisioning and educational scoring. A third draft of the code on GPAI models is slated for publication that same month. European tech leaders are concerned about the risk that punitive EU measures on U.S. tech firms could provoke a reaction from Trump, which might in turn cause the bloc to soften its approach. Take antitrust regulation, for example. The EU's been an active player taking action to curb U.S. tech giants' dominance — but that's something that could result in a negative response from Trump, according to Swiss VPN firm Proton's CEO Andy Yen. \"[Trump's] view is he probably wants to regulate his tech companies himself,\" Yen told CNBC in a November interview at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. \"He doesn't want Europe to get involved.\"\n\nUK copyright review\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer gives a media interview while attending the 79th United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, U.S. September 25, 2024. Leon Neal | Via Reuters\n\nOne country to watch for is the U.K. Previously, Britain has shied away from introducing statutory obligations for AI model makers due to the fear that new legislation could be too restrictive. However, Keir Starmer's government has said it plans to draw up legislation for AI, although details remain thin for now. The general expectation is that the U.K. will take a more principles-based approach to AI regulation, as opposed to the EU's risk-based framework. Last month, the government dropped its first major indicator for where regulation is moving, announcing a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Copyright is a big issue for generative AI and LLMs, in particular. Most LLMs use public data from the open web to train their AI models. But that often includes examples of artwork and other copyrighted material. Artists and publishers like the New York Times allege that these systems are unfairly scraping their valuable content without consent to generate original output. To address this issue, the U.K. government is considering making an exception to copyright law for AI model training, while still allowing rights holders to opt out of having their works used for training purposes. Appian's Calkins said that the U.K. could end up being a \"global leader\" on the issue of copyright infringement by AI models, adding that the country isn't \"subject to the same overwhelming lobbying blitz from domestic AI leaders that the U.S. is.\"\n\nU.S.-China relations a possible point of tension\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Xi Jinping, China's president, walk past members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLastly, as world governments seek to regulate fast-growing AI systems, there's a risk geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. In his first term as president, Trump enforced a number of hawkish policy measures on China, including a decision to add Huawei to a trade blacklist restricting it from doing business with American tech suppliers. He also launched a bid to ban TikTok,which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, in the U.S. — although he's since softened his position on TikTok. China is racing to beat the U.S. for dominance in AI. At the same time, the U.S. has taken measures to restrict China's access to key technologies, mainly chips like those designed by Nvidia, which are required to train more advanced AI models. China has responded by attempting to build its own homegrown chip industry. Technologists worry that a geopolitical fracturing between the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence could result in other risks, such as the potential for one of the two to develop a form of AI smarter than humans. Max Tegmark, founder of the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, believes the U.S. and China could in future create a form of AI that can improve itself and design new systems without human supervision, potentially forcing both countries' governments to individually come up with rules around AI safety. \"My optimistic path forward is the U.S. and China unilaterally impose national safety standards to prevent their own companies from doing harm and building uncontrollable AGI, not to appease the rivals superpowers, but just to protect themselves,\" Tegmark told CNBC in a November interview. Governments are already trying to work together to figure out how to create regulations and frameworks around AI. In 2023, the U.K. hosted a global AI safety summit, which the U.S. and China administrations both attended, to discuss potential guardrails around the technology. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report",

As Shelley McKinley, chief legal officer of popular code repository platform GitHub, told CNBC in November, \"the next phase of the work has started, which may mean there's more ahead of us than there is behind us at this point.\" For example, in February, the first provisions of the Act will become enforceable. These provisions cover \"high-risk\" AI applications such as remote biometric identification, loan decisioning and educational scoring. A third draft of the code on GPAI models is slated for publication that same month. European tech leaders are concerned about the risk that punitive EU measures on U.S. tech firms could provoke a reaction from Trump, which might in turn cause the bloc to soften its approach. Take antitrust regulation, for example. The EU's been an active player taking action to curb U.S. tech giants' dominance — but that's something that could result in a negative response from Trump, according to Swiss VPN firm Proton's CEO Andy Yen. \"[Trump's] view is he probably wants to regulate his tech companies himself,\" Yen told CNBC in a November interview at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. \"He doesn't want Europe to get involved.\"\n\nUK copyright review\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer gives a media interview while attending the 79th United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, U.S. September 25, 2024. Leon Neal | Via Reuters\n\nOne country to watch for is the U.K. Previously, Britain has shied away from introducing statutory obligations for AI model makers due to the fear that new legislation could be too restrictive. However, Keir Starmer's government has said it plans to draw up legislation for AI, although details remain thin for now. The general expectation is that the U.K. will take a more principles-based approach to AI regulation, as opposed to the EU's risk-based framework. Last month, the government dropped its first major indicator for where regulation is moving, announcing a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Copyright is a big issue for generative AI and LLMs, in particular. Most LLMs use public data from the open web to train their AI models. But that often includes examples of artwork and other copyrighted material. Artists and publishers like the New York Times allege that these systems are unfairly scraping their valuable content without consent to generate original output. To address this issue, the U.K. government is considering making an exception to copyright law for AI model training, while still allowing rights holders to opt out of having their works used for training purposes. Appian's Calkins said that the U.K. could end up being a \"global leader\" on the issue of copyright infringement by AI models, adding that the country isn't \"subject to the same overwhelming lobbying blitz from domestic AI leaders that the U.S. is.\"\n\nU.S.-China relations a possible point of tension\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Xi Jinping, China's president, walk past members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLastly, as world governments seek to regulate fast-growing AI systems, there's a risk geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. In his first term as president, Trump enforced a number of hawkish policy measures on China, including a decision to add Huawei to a trade blacklist restricting it from doing business with American tech suppliers. He also launched a bid to ban TikTok,which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, in the U.S. — although he's since softened his position on TikTok. China is racing to beat the U.S. for dominance in AI. At the same time, the U.S. has taken measures to restrict China's access to key technologies, mainly chips like those designed by Nvidia, which are required to train more advanced AI models. China has responded by attempting to build its own homegrown chip industry. Technologists worry that a geopolitical fracturing between the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence could result in other risks, such as the potential for one of the two to develop a form of AI smarter than humans. Max Tegmark, founder of the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, believes the U.S. and China could in future create a form of AI that can improve itself and design new systems without human supervision, potentially forcing both countries' governments to individually come up with rules around AI safety. \"My optimistic path forward is the U.S. and China unilaterally impose national safety standards to prevent their own companies from doing harm and building uncontrollable AGI, not to appease the rivals superpowers, but just to protect themselves,\" Tegmark told CNBC in a November interview. Governments are already trying to work together to figure out how to create regulations and frameworks around AI. In 2023, the U.K. hosted a global AI safety summit, which the U.S. and China administrations both attended, to discuss potential guardrails around the technology. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report"

Impact Link\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nTesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" becomes law.\n\nElon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost.\n\nMany of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts. That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly affect his businesses.\n\nWhile Musk has previously shared his disapproval of the bill, the billionaire ratcheted up his criticism this week.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk posted on X on Tuesday. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\"\n\n\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said in criticism directed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill.\n\nMusk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the President already knew where Musk stood on the spending bill and that the Tesla CEO's recent comments criticizing it wouldn't change Trump's stance.\n\nThe bill, which champions Trump's agenda, includes cuts to Medicaid and the extension of the tax cuts that the president signed into law during his first term in 2017. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime.\n\nIn regard to the companies Musk leads, the bill could have a mixed impact. While Tesla stands to lose, companies such as SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill.\n\nTesla's credits threatened\n\nThe bill, as written, makes big changes to the Biden-era EV tax credits, which are intended to encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used EVs.\n\nElectric vehicles would no longer qualify for the tax credit if the automaker sold more than 200,000 previously qualifying EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, if the bill became law. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone.\n\nMusk has previously said eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and affect the automaker as well. He said, however, that the move would probably help Tesla in the long term. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOthers don't seem sold on Musk's rationale.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told Business Insider that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit would be \"the biggest area that could impact Tesla.\"\n\n\"Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,\" Goldstein said. \"It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.\"\n\nGoldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has been struggling with.\n\nThe JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatened more than half of Tesla's 2025 profits.\n\nBrinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax and could result in a $1.2 billion headwind. He added that the automaker could face a $2 billion headwind from the removal of CARB ZEV credit sales, which encourage the sales of zero-emission vehicles.\n\nTesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its coming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. Brinkman said any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business was years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would most likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer,\" Brinkman wrote.\n\nGoldstein said the removal of the tax credit could \"accelerate\" Tesla's transition to an AI and robotics company.\n\nIt's also possible that the expiration of the EV tax credit on Tesla vehicles could spur some short-term demand from buyers looking to purchase one of the company's EVs before the window closes.\n\nTrump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.\n\nAs written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump entered the political scene.\n\nThe spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is \"growing like wildfire,\" by ending energy tax credits. The automaker's energy generation and storage business, which includes Tesla's Megapack and Powerwall battery systems , brought in $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 67% increase from the year prior.\n\nMusk shared a post on X from the official Tesla Energy account that said, \"Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid.\"\n\nTesla Energy also added that it was urging the Senate to enact legislation with a \"sensible wind down\" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing.\n\n\"This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who's a noted Tesla bull, told BI.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nXAI may benefit from AI regulation changes\n\nTrump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.\n\nOne section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI.\n\nThat could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down.\n\nThe bill also allocated funds toward modernizing the federal IT system with AI and improving the cybersecurity of its systems. With the government setting money aside to improve its systems, xAI, one of the companies at the forefront of the AI race, could be contracted to power the modernization efforts.",

Tesla Energy urged the Senate to enact legislation for a sensible wind-down of energy tax credits. The proposed bill prohibits state and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade and allocates funds for modernizing federal IT systems with AI and improving cybersecurity."

Tesla is particularly vulnerable after Mr. Musk’s popularity nose-dived when he slashed government jobs. Tesla dealerships became the target of protests as sales and profit fell. What’s more, the Republican budget bill now before the Senate would gut subsidies and policies that promote electric vehicles. Tesla’s stock has dropped about 14 percent this year, wiping around $180 billion off its market value.\n\nSome of Mr. Musk’s companies have benefited from his proximity to the White House, with Mr. Trump at one point promoting Tesla cars on the White House lawn and SpaceX harvesting more government tie-ups with Starlink, its satellite internet service. X remains a powerful megaphone for Mr. Musk’s and Mr. Trump’s supporters. And Mr. Trump is a valuable ally with policy power who oversees agencies that regulate Mr. Musk’s businesses.\n\nBut Mr. Musk is the face of his companies, and his protracted time in Washington has raised alarms over how committed he is to his businesses. Some former workers at SpaceX and elsewhere have questioned his absence from the companies. Overall, it’s unclear if the tech billionaire’s Washington maneuvers will lead to long-term advantages for them.\n\n“It became a mission critical thing to get the C.E.O. back in the office,” said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. “It’s not a moment too soon, quite frankly.”\n\nHow much time Mr. Musk will spend with his companies and outside Washington now remains unclear. At a news conference in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump on Friday, Mr. Musk called his departure from the government “not the end of DOGE but really the beginning” and said he would continue to visit “and be a friend and an adviser to the president.”",

        "position": 3,
        "content": "Billionaire Elon Musk blasted the massive tax and immigration bill at the heart of President Donald Trump’s agenda on Tuesday, calling the measure “a disgusting abomination” that would burden the country with “crushingly unsustainable debt.” Though Musk — who on Friday left his post as head of the U.S. DOGE Service, Trump’s cost-cutting effort — had previously criticized the bill in gentler terms, his posts on X, the social media platform he owns, represented his sharpest attack yet on the Trump White House. For months, Musk had played the role of the president’s “first buddy,” joining Trump frequently in the Oval Office and exhorting the administration to cut government spending.\n\nThe posts appeared to complicate the path to passage for the legislation, which barely passed the House late last month after conservatives revolted over its enormous price tag. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The Senate began consideration of the measure this week, and GOP leaders hope to have it to Trump’s desk by July 4. Trump has encouraged lawmakers to pass the measure, but some Republican Senate budget hawks applauded Musk’s attack Tuesday, a potential sign of trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”\n\nHe wrote minutes later: “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” That post appeared to confuse the annual deficit with the overall increase to the debt over 10 years.\n\nShortly after that, he wrote, “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”\n\nThe bill would extend tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term and make good on new campaign promises — including no taxes on tips or overtime wages — while devoting hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to defense and immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk’s attack landed while Senate Republicans huddled for a lunch with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who predicted robust economic growth if the legislation passes, lawmakers said. Many economists outside the White House disagree with that projection, arguing that rising national debt will crowd out private-sector investment.\n\nIn the Senate, lawmakers are haggling over whether to make additional budget cuts in the legislation — which would already slice more than $1 trillion from social safety net and anti-poverty programs — and to preserve some Biden-era clean energy initiatives, which would add to the bill’s cost.\n\nMainstream Republicans in the lunch meeting with Hassett greeted Musk’s posts with “an eyeball roll,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota) said.\n\n“We have a difference of opinion. He’s entitled to that opinion. We’re going to proceed full speed ahead,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for budget hawks — and Democrats — Musk provided a shot in the arm. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) called for splitting up Trump’s legislation into multiple smaller bills, saying one sweeping measure with such a large deficit hit couldn’t get the votes to pass the upper chamber.\n\n“I think Elon is exactly right that we need to cut more spending, and I hope and believe that the Senate will make the bill substantially better,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who interviewed Musk on his podcast in March and has described him as a friend.\n\nAsked how much more spending he would like to cut from the bill, Cruz said, “As much as humanly possible.”\n\nDemocrats enjoyed watching the GOP infighting.\n\n“I hear something happened while we were at lunch,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) joked while holding up a poster board of Musk’s tweets, “which led me to make some news here today and say something I didn’t think was imaginable: I agree with Elon Musk.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off Musk’s posts.\n\n“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” she said. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”\n\nThe legislation would undo most of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which poured federal tax incentives into production of electric vehicles, batteries and solar energy — cornerstones of Musk’s businesses. Tesla, in particular, suffered as Musk’s DOGE efforts became less popular: The EV maker reported a 71 percent plunge in profits in the first quarter. One person who has interacted with Musk over the years and closely followed his journey from Tesla to the White House said the bill could prompt frustrations with Republicans similar to Musk’s irritation with Democrats under the Biden administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It increases the deficit by trillions of dollars, kills solar and battery credits, sunsets battery production credits in 2028, kills the EV tax credit,” the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. “Elon and the Republicans were united in not liking the previous administration. As they get into governance, they are finding that is where the similarities end.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) pushed back on Musk’s criticism.\n\n“With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nThe speaker said that he and Musk talked about the legislation and other topics for 20 minutes Monday and that the two appeared to end the phone conversation on common ground.\n\n“Elon is missing it, okay?” Johnson added. “And it’s not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to him; that is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal. And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that. … But for him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing, very surprising, in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main focus of the legislation is extending parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first term, that are set to expire at the end of the year. Virtually every tax filer would pay more if the bill doesn’t pass. It would also devote $150 billion for immigration enforcement, another Trump administration priority.\n\nTo pay for the tax cut extensions, the bill would tighten eligibility for Medicaid, which the Congressional Budget Office says would leave millions of people uninsured. The bill would also pass on to states billions of dollars of expenses for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. That could lead local officials to sharply raise taxes or enact policies that kick families off SNAP.\n\nRepublicans also want to use some of the unilateral spending cuts made by Musk’s DOGE — which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, though it is not a Cabinet-level agency — to balance out the costs of the tax cuts. Many of those cuts are being challenged in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk on May 20 said he would stop spending on political causes and leave the White House to return to his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. He spent nearly $300 million, almost entirely on Republican candidates and causes, in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nFriday was his last day in the White House, and he and Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nFaiz Siddiqui, Mariana Alfaro, Liz Goodwin and Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed back on Musk’s criticism, calling him \"terribly wrong\" despite having spoken with Musk on Monday about the legislation, a conversation Johnson said ended on common ground. Earlier, on May 20, Musk had stated he would stop political spending and leave the White House to return to his companies. Friday marked his last day in the White House, where he and Trump spoke to reporters."

        "content": "Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon\n\nWhy eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet\n\nMorgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be \"tempted to solve\" another \"problem\" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is \"commercialising air taxis,\" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, \"eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.\"Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.",

Neuralink said the fresh capital will help the company bring its technology to more patients and develop new devices that “deepen the connection between biological and artificial intelligence.”\n\nNeuralink is building a brain-computer interface, or BCI, which is a system that translates brain signals into commands for external technologies.\n\nThe company’s first system, called Telepathy, involves 64 “threads” that are inserted directly into the brain. The threads are thinner than a human hair and record neural signals through 1,024 electrodes, according to Neuralink’s website.\n\nThe initial aim of the technology is to help patients with severe paralysis restore some independence. As of Monday, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink’s technology, and are able to “control digital and physical devices with their thoughts,” the release said.\n\nNeuralink is currently carrying out four separate clinical trials around its Telepathy system.\n\nBCIs have been studied in academia for decades, and several other companies, including Synchron, Paradromics and Precision Neuroscience, are developing their own systems.\n\nParadromics on Monday announced it successfully implanted its BCI in a human for the first time.\n\nIt’s not clear what devices Neuralink will look to develop next, but Musk has for years espoused grand ambitions for the brain tech startup. He has even claimed that he would be willing to get an implant himself.\n\nOne of the capabilities Musk has repeatedly highlighted is the ability to restore vision to blind patients.\n\nNeuralink received a “Breakthrough Device” designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a device called Blindsight. This designation is granted to medical devices that have the potential to provide improved treatment for debilitating or life-threatening conditions.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform X in September, Musk said Blindsight will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see.\n\nNeuralink still has a long road ahead before it can commercialize these technologies.",

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nTesla makes EVs, batteries, robots, and startups.\n\nA steady stream of employees — the \"Tesla mafia\" — have left to found companies in everything from EVs and batteries to robotics and electric boats.\n\nElectric car startup Lucid was founded by former Tesla executives back in 2007, and the ex-Tesla founders of British EV startup Longbow previously told Business Insider they aimed to deliver a Roadster sports car before Elon Musk's company.\n\nFormer senior employees who then raised large amounts for their own startups include former senior vice president of energy Drew Baglino, whose energy firm Heron Power reportedly raised a Series A round of over $30 million in April. Automotive tech startup Tekion, founded by Tesla's former chief information officer Jay Vijayan, is now valued at over $4 billion.\n\n\"The success rate of former Tesla employees starting their own companies, building hard things, is exceptionally high,\" Chris Walti, Tesla's former Optimus lead, told BI.\n\nBI spoke to Walti and two other former Tesla employees about why so many of its former employees have gone on to startup success.\n\n'It's not a Google-like culture, and it's not a 9-to-5 experience'\n\nGene Berdichevsky, CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies and Tesla's seventh ever employee, said what sets working at the company apart is the sense of \"radical self-reliance.\"\n\n\"It's kind of the belief that when you're doing new things, there are no experts to ask, there are no suppliers who have done it before. If there are, you're probably not doing something particularly novel,\" said Berdichevsky, who left the company in 2008.\n\nWalti, who left the company in 2022 after seven years to start robotics firm Mytra, told BI that Tesla gave engineers unprecedented freedom and responsibility to tackle \"really big problems.\"\n\n\"You can solve problems without requiring 20 product managers and five VPs for approval. Here's the problem: go figure it out, go solve it, go talk to whoever you need to get it done,\" Walti said.\n\nSila Nanotechnologies CEO Gene Berdichevsky was Tesla's seventh ever employee. Sila Nanotechnologies\n\nWhile Tesla's lack of bureaucracy may be liberating, the company is also known for its intense work culture.\n\nMusk and other senior figures have previously slept on the factory floor during crises, and employees are expected to work long hours to meet the billionaires' tight deadlines.\n\n\"Tesla is not an easy place to work, but it was never intended to be. It's not a Google-like culture, and it's not a 9-to-5 experience,\" said Berdichevsky.\n\nWalti said Tesla employees used to jokingly warn each other not to \"fly too close to the sun,\" with Musk having little tolerance for failure.\n\n\"Elon has a short fuse. It doesn't matter how many successful projects you've delivered,\" he said. \"You screw up once and you might be out.\"\n\nWalti added that the intensity of working with Musk led some people to \"burn out,\" and said that working in a system where employees had little say over product direction could be frustrating.\n\n\"If you're not too close to the sun, it's a wonderful place to work because you get to work on really meaty problems. You get the innovation, the scale, the tech risk, and you're surrounded by a bunch of really innovative people,\" he said.\n\nChris Walti led Tesla's robotics team and spearheaded development of the company's Optimus robot. Mytra\n\n\"On the flip side, it doesn't give you a lot of agency over why you're building things. You'll be told 'make the Cybertruck float,' and at no point is there a debate on why; it was like, just go do it,\" Walti added.\n\nLeaving Tesla\n\nTobias Kahnert, who founded powertrain startup EFT Mobility, said that starting a new company is often more attractive than taking a job at a rival for Tesla employees.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"We used to call it internally 'the Mount Everest syndrome',\" said Tobias Kahnert, who was a senior software engineer at Tesla from 2014 to 2017.\n\nKahnert joined Tesla right out of college and worked there through the \"production hell\" of ramping the Model 3 mass-market EV. The idea of founding his own company felt like a natural next move, he said.\n\n\"I couldn't see a more exciting company in the world at that point\" than Tesla, he said. \"The option was either I stay with that company until retirement, which is a long time away, or I start something myself,\" he said.\n\nKahnert said the most valuable lesson he learned at Tesla was how to innovate quickly without losing track of the need to scale a product.\n\n\"The stretch between these two worlds is something you learn quite quickly at Tesla. You need this spirit of challenging the norms, seeing what's possible, and figuring out ways to get it done without being bogged down too much in processes,\" said Kahnert.\n\nTobias Kahnert worked as a senior software engineer during Tesla's Model 3 production ramp. Electric Flytrain\n\n\"But you also actually need to get on the level of working with the process and alongside regulations to even have a product that you can bring into the market,\" he added.\n\nWalti said Tesla offered a unique experience within engineering of building hard things at scale on a tight timeline, which he called a \"trifecta\" of speed, scale, and innovation.\n\n\"Usually, you have to pick two of the three. At places like Boeing or Lockheed, you're building hard things with innovation, but the timelines are, like, 10 years,\" said Walti.\n\n\"Tesla is a unique place because of the scale. Startups are fast and innovative, but not yet scaled. Innovating with speed at scale is an interesting nexus that really accelerates learning,\" he added.\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",

Doing one thing every day that makes you smarter is a good goal to have. Here's my suggestion for today: Subscribe to BI Tech Memo . Alistair Barr is the best in the biz at breaking down what's going on in Big Tech. (And it's free!)\n\nIn today's big story, Elon Musk had some not-so-nice things to say about President Donald Trump's tax bill.\n\nWhat's on deck\n\nMarkets: They might be in secondaries, but they're still on top. Meet the key execs in Wall Street's hottest market .\n\nTech: What a top Microsoft exec learned from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy .\n\nBusiness: Florida real estate is showing cracks , and it could be a red flag for the rest of the country.\n\nBut first, I just can't stand it anymore.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nElon has something to say\n\nAllison Robbert / AFP via Getty Images\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Elon Musk doesn't see anything pretty in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThe billionaire railed against President Donald Trump's tax bill Tuesday afternoon, calling it a \" disgusting abomination .\"\n\nMusk, known for keeping his opinions to himself, posted on X that he \"just can't stand it anymore,\" before criticizing the \"massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.\"\n\n\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he added.\n\nHe's not the only one attacking Trump's bill. Some within the president's own party have gone after it for fueling the government's growing deficit .\n\nChris Unger/Getty Images\n\nSo what's behind Musk's outburst?\n\nWe're less than a week removed from his decision to leave Washington . Why jump back into the fray?\n\nHere's what could be rubbing him the wrong way about the bill:\n\nDOGE disappointment: According to one estimate, Trump's tax bill will increase the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's probably a difficult pill to swallow for Musk, who was tasked with cutting that down via DOGE.\n\nThe group took extreme measures trying to achieve that, and Musk faced plenty of professional and personal backlash. Now he's seeing the tax bill \"undermine\" — his words, not mine — all of that work.\n\nMusk Inc. and the tax bill: Despite his recent foray into politics, Musk is still a business owner at heart. Trump's tax bill has real implications for his companies, both good (SpaceX) and bad (Tesla). BI's Ana Altchek, Alice Tecotzky and Kelsey Vlamis have a breakdown on what it means for his portfolio .\n\nThe end of a friendship: Since the Trump-Musk bromance first blossomed, people have speculated when it might end. As BI's Peter Kafka put it shortly after the election , \"both men are famously short-fused\" and \"adore the spotlight.\"\n\n\"And that combination makes it easy to imagine a break-up down the line,\" Peter added.\n\nWe've seen cracks in the relationship before. The dustup over the government funding bill led to jokes about Musk being the real leader of the GOP. That elicited a response from a Trump spokesperson . Musk also clashed with Trump's base over H-1B visas .\n\nJust Elon being Elon: Sometimes the best explanation is the simplest. Musk has a history of shooting from the hip with his takes. (Being the richest person in the world affords you that privilege.) He's already said that he and Trump didn't always see eye to eye . This could just be another example of that.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nI-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\n1. The Nvidia hype is back. The chip giant's stock has climbed 20% over the last month. After bottoming in April during a broader market sell-off, Nvidia's stock is now up 45%. These are four big catalysts spurring it on.\n\n2. Six Wall Street veterans on the best trades they've ever made. Senior money managers told BI about the highlights of their investing careers, from buying undervalued stocks to making well-timed exits. One talked about shorting GameStop .\n\n3. Power players in secondaries. The secondaries market — in which investors buy and sell secondhand shares of private funds — is on pace to break last year's record highs of $160 billion. Meet 14 people who took the industry from niche to new heights.\n\n3 things in tech\n\nHarry Murphy/Sportsfile for Web Summit via Getty Images\n\n1. How can you make AI your coworker, not your replacement? The HR-tech startup Lattice thinks it has the answer. The CEO of the company, which makes AI agents for the workplace, told BI that embracing AI now would help protect jobs , not threaten them.\n\n2. Microsoft's copycat strategy. The company's latest exec Jay Parikh is adopting Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's strategies for his new AI organization, Core AI, according to an internal email viewed by BI. Parikh shared takeaways from an annual letter Jassy sent to Amazon shareholders in a memo. Here are three of his takeaways .\n\n3. The pure internet is gone. Did anyone save a copy? Since ChatGPT came out, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. That's sent researchers diving deep to preserve content made by humans prior to 2022, BI's Alistair Barr writes .\n\n3 things in business\n\nFound Image Holdings/Corbis via Getty Images; Rebecca Zisser/BI\n\n1. Trouble in paradise. Florida was the undisputed winner of the pandemic relocation boom, luring millions of new residents with its beaches and low taxes. Now, Floridians are experiencing an affordability crisis, hurricane-fueled insurance nightmares, and more. It's also a warning for America's real-estate market .\n\n2. A business immigration lawyer on Trump 2.0. The Trump administration is being as strict as possible when it comes to work-visa applications, attorney Jason Finkelman told BI. With the amount of effort and hoops to jump through, Finkelman believes it's designed to frustrate US companies into giving up on hiring foreign workers .\n\n3. This longtime middle manager supports flattening middle management. Alvaro Munevar Jr. told BI he'd seen middle management practices that siloed workers and slowed productivity . But as Big Tech culls those roles, the remaining ones could still evolve significantly. A LinkedIn executive said managers will need to be more like coaches to keep teams' energy up.\n\nIn other news\n\nWhat's happening today\n\nUS doubles tariff on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.\n\nSentencing for man convicted of murder in fatal stabbing of Cash App founder Bill Lee.\n\nThe Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

        "content": "The tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday apply to most of the world.\n\nPresident Trump announced what could be one of the most drastic economic policy changes in decades on Wednesday, when he substituted America’s longstanding system of taxing imports with a new tariff system of his own devising.\n\nThe president said the tariffs would reverse decades of what he called unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States.\n\n“The markets are going to boom” and “the country is going to boom,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday, as global financial markets suffered their biggest rout in years. He added that other countries “have taken advantage of us for many, many years.”\n\nEconomists’ estimates have been far more grim, with most predicting that the president’s sweeping tariffs and likely retaliation will slow U.S. economic growth, push up costs for consumers and make life difficult for businesses that depend on international supply chains.\n\nThe president’s measure is both consequential and complicated.\n\nWhat did the president just do?\n\nMr. Trump announced two big tariff plans that apply to most of the world. One component is a “base line” tariff of 10 percent that will apply broadly to nearly all U.S. imports, except for products coming from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe second measure is what the president is calling a “reciprocal” tariff. That levy will apply to 57 countries that Mr. Trump says have high tariffs and other unfair economic practices that have hurt American exporters. He said this is a reciprocal tariff because it will match the way other countries treat the United States.\n\nBut the tariff that Mr. Trump announced is not actually based on other countries’ tariffs or other economic barriers to U.S. trade. The number is calculated based on the U.S. trade deficit, which is a measure of the difference between what the United States sells to a country and what it buys from it.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs range from 1 percent to 40 percent and will be added to the 10 percent base line tariff.\n\nThe 10 percent tariffs will go into effect on Saturday, and the reciprocal rates next Wednesday.\n\nWhich countries were targeted most by the tariffs?\n\nThe tariffs put a heavy burden on some of America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Japan, Germany, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nNotably, Canada and Mexico were not included. Mr. Trump hit those countries with a 25 percent tariff on many of their exports last month, though he also provided an exception for products that qualify for the trade agreement he signed in 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The countries are also subject to tariffs Mr. Trump has applied globally on cars, steel and aluminum, and the administration appears to have decided that America’s closest neighbors did not need further tariffs.\n\nBut the new tariffs will hit other allies with substantial levies. European goods will face a 20 percent tariff, Japanese goods will face 24 percent and South Korean products 26 percent.\n\nBecause of the way the tariff was calculated, Asian countries that send the United States a lot of exports but don’t buy much in return will see some of the highest rates.\n\nChinese exports face an extra 34 percent tariff. That is on top of a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump applied in recent months and other levies from his first term. As a result, some products from China will face a tariff of 79 percent.\n\nVietnam — where many companies moved their factories after Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term — will now face a 46 percent tariff on its exports, while Cambodian exports will be taxed at 49 percent.\n\nThe White House also did not apply tariffs to Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, arguing that these countries are already subject to heavy sanctions. But U.S. imports from Russia were $3 billion last year; small compared to many countries, but far larger than tiny countries like Lesotho and the Falkland Islands, which Mr. Trump chose to hit with substantial tariffs.\n\nWhat is the president’s goal?\n\nImage Mr. Trump said the tariffs will reverse decades of unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nThe president and his advisers say their goal is to make the tariffs so painful that they force companies to make their products in the United States. They argue that this will create more American jobs and push up wages.\n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”\n\nOne of the biggest questions is whether the president sees these tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and would be willing to remove them in return for concessions from other countries.\n\nThe administration has given mixed signals on that front. It seems unlikely that the president will remove the 10 percent base line tariff he has issued globally. And if the administration is truly looking for U.S. trade deficits with other countries to be eliminated, that may be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nBut in the executive order he signed, the president said that if countries eliminate their unfair trade practices, or the U.S. trade deficit with them drops, the reciprocal tariffs could be rolled back.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the commerce secretary, described other countries’ trade barriers as “the monster that needs to be slayed.”\n\n“Our teams are talking to all the great trading partners today,” Mr. Lutnick said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “It is time for them to do deep soul-searching on how they treat us poorly and how to make it right.”\n\nHow did they come up with the numbers?\n\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that each nation’s tariff rate would be calculated based on “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.” But it turned out that their methodology revolved around something more straightforward: the gap between what America exports to a country and what it imports.\n\nThe White House put out a complicated-looking formula, but it boiled down to a simple ratio. Countries that send the U.S. more goods than they buy were deemed to have “unbalanced” trade and will face higher tariffs.\n\nThis formula doesn’t account for any comparative advantage, or the idea that countries trade goods because some are better at making some products than others, and that countries can trade to maximize their benefits. Instead, the administration’s point of view appears to be that any trade deficit is bad, and tariffs will be applied until it is eliminated.\n\nHow do the tariffs work?\n\nAs they go into effect over the next week, the tariffs will immediately increase the cost for importers bringing goods into the country. Typically, those importers are U.S. companies.\n\nFor example, if Walmart brings in a $10 shoe from Vietnam — which faces a 46 percent tariff — Walmart will owe $4.60 in additional tariffs to the U.S. government.\n\nIt’s less clear what happens next. Walmart could try to force the cost onto the Vietnamese shoe manufacturer, by telling it Walmart will pay less for the product. Walmart could cut into its own profit margins and absorb the cost of the tariff. Or, it could raise the price it sells shoes for at its stores, to make up the cost.\n\nEconomists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that the tariffs on steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.\n\nEstimates vary, but given the scale of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs, American households could see thousands of dollars of additional costs annually. An estimate released by the Yale Budget Lab, a research group, found that American households on average would pay an additional $2,100 because of the April 2 announcement, with poorer households paying a larger share of their income.\n\nThe particularly high tariffs that the Trump administration applied to many Asian countries means that the price of many consumer items will likely increase, including shoes, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe government will earn a lot more revenue from tariffs that the Trump administration has promised to channel into tax cuts. The value of tariffs for all the goods imported by the United States last year was $78 billion. With the new tariffs announced on Wednesday, the figure would skyrocket to more than $1 trillion, according to an analysis by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a research firm based in Washington.\n\nWhat happens next with the economy?\n\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets, indicating that investors see it as significantly harmful for listed companies.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, or how, other countries will retaliate. But if they impose their own tariffs on U.S. products, that will likely hurt U.S. exporters and could spark escalating trade wars.\n\nMany analysts quickly downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, saying that tariffs would push up prices for consumers and costs for businesses, slowing demand and economic activity.\n\nNancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, estimated the U.S. economy might contract 1 percent in the second quarter. She had previously expected a flat quarter. “It’s an immediate hit to the economy,” she said.\n\nEconomists at Fitch Ratings said in a note Thursday that the tariffs had significantly raised the risk for a recession in the United States. It said that tariffs would result in higher consumer prices that would squeeze real wages and weigh on consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs would also lead to lower corporate profits, which, along with policy uncertainty, would drag on business investment in the United States. Altogether, the effect would “likely outweigh the benefits U.S. companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch economists said.\n\nLazaro Gamio and Colby Smith contributed reporting.",

Or, it could raise the price it sells shoes for at its stores, to make up the cost.\n\nEconomists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that the tariffs on steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.\n\nEstimates vary, but given the scale of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs, American households could see thousands of dollars of additional costs annually. An estimate released by the Yale Budget Lab, a research group, found that American households on average would pay an additional $2,100 because of the April 2 announcement, with poorer households paying a larger share of their income.\n\nThe particularly high tariffs that the Trump administration applied to many Asian countries means that the price of many consumer items will likely increase, including shoes, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe government will earn a lot more revenue from tariffs that the Trump administration has promised to channel into tax cuts. The value of tariffs for all the goods imported by the United States last year was $78 billion. With the new tariffs announced on Wednesday, the figure would skyrocket to more than $1 trillion, according to an analysis by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a research firm based in Washington.\n\nWhat happens next with the economy?\n\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets, indicating that investors see it as significantly harmful for listed companies.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, or how, other countries will retaliate. But if they impose their own tariffs on U.S. products, that will likely hurt U.S. exporters and could spark escalating trade wars.\n\nMany analysts quickly downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, saying that tariffs would push up prices for consumers and costs for businesses, slowing demand and economic activity.\n\nNancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, estimated the U.S. economy might contract 1 percent in the second quarter. She had previously expected a flat quarter. “It’s an immediate hit to the economy,” she said.\n\nEconomists at Fitch Ratings said in a note Thursday that the tariffs had significantly raised the risk for a recession in the United States. It said that tariffs would result in higher consumer prices that would squeeze real wages and weigh on consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs would also lead to lower corporate profits, which, along with policy uncertainty, would drag on business investment in the United States. Altogether, the effect would “likely outweigh the benefits U.S. companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch economists said.\n\nLazaro Gamio and Colby Smith contributed reporting."

Trump referred to several days as \"liberation day\" during his last presidential campaign. In February 2024, he told a conservative audience that Election Day, Nov. 5, \"will he our liberation day\" and repeated it several times after that.

Trump has already announced a lot of tariffs — on imported steel and aluminum, which are already in effect; on imported autos and auto parts, which are set to go into effect at midnight April 3, and have Detroit automakers extraordinarily concerned about the additional pressures and costs to Canadian and Mexican supply lines they rely on; on Chinese goods generally and any country buying oil from Venezuela — but the new set of taxes or tariffs are a mystery for now.\n\nTrump first talked about a broad series of import tariffs that would not only match the tariffs charged by other countries but also account for other economic obstacles to U.S. trade, such as quotas that might limit the level of imports allowed into a country, or value-added taxes like those in Europe and elsewhere that can add to the price of imported goods. Then, as recently as last week, he was talking about being more lenient, saying otherwise his plans might be too tough and it looked like it might be restricted to certain trading partners.

After imposing the auto tariffs last week, Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had a call after which Trump suggested negotiations were possible, adding, \"I think things will work out very well between Canada and the United States.\"\n\nDoes Trump have a point on trade and tariffs?\n\nThe United States runs a deficit in terms of its trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. In January of this year, that deficit — meaning the value of imports compared with the value of U.S. exports — was about $131 billion, up from about $98 billion in December. The U.S. hasn't run a trade surplus, however, since the mid-1970s.\n\nTrump has consistently argued that is proof the U.S. is treated unfairly by its trading partners, and some labor leaders, including the UAW's Shawn Fain, have agreed, in part, saying tariffs will result in more work for U.S.-based manufacturing. And there are some claims that the U.S. may be more vulnerable financially or militarily if it doesn't protect its ability to make things.\n\nBut there is another argument that in a world with global supply chains, it makes more sense economically and diplomatically for the U.S. to spend less than it otherwise might on some consumer goods by using imports to lower prices on some items, freeing up more for wages, savings, investment and other goods. It is hard for economists to imagine U.S. wages falling to a level where they would meet those in some other parts of the world and provide an advantage for U.S. exports. Meanwhile, there are questions as to what damage could be done to businesses; major manufacturers are not able to willy-nilly change product lines, open factories and alter supply chains, circumstances that can take years to plan and execute, lasting longer than a president's term.\n\nIf Trump is able to use tariffs as a way to pull more business into the U.S. and negotiate better access to foreign markets for American-made goods, while raising some revenue for the federal government to offset promised tax extensions, he may be widely praised. If, on the other hand, his actions lead to a possible recession — after what had been a period of stock market and job expansion, despite higher prices — it could lead to strong reaction among the public, if history is any guide.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — In President Donald Trump’s idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s, when top hats and shirtwaists were fashionable and typhoid fever often killed more soldiers than combat.\n\nIt was the Gilded Age, a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system, when poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth, like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped boost their financial empires.\n\n“We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept,” Trump said days after taking office. “It’s fine. It’s OK. But it would have been very much better.”\n\nThe desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump’s fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation’s 25th president, William McKinley, a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901.\n\nThough Trump’s early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent — with him imposing them, then pulling many back — he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country’s foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump doesn’t rule out recession while downplaying business concerns about his tariffs\n\nExperts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They argue he’s also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods.\n\nAnd Gilded Age policies, they maintain, have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized, modern economy.\n\n“The most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy — except for the very rich — wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy,” said Richard White, a history professor emeritus at Stanford University.\n\nTrump says high tariffs and low interest rates, like those the U.S. had after the Civil War, can hastily pay down today’s federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S.\n\nIt’s not a new theme for him.\n\n“I am a Tariff Man,” Trump declared in a 2018 online post. Campaigning for a second term last fall, Trump said of the McKinley era, “We were a very wealthy country, and we’re going to be doing that now.” Today, he says “tariff” is his favorite word and represents “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form.”\n\nThe White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising that import levies will soon increase on the European Union, as well as new, foreign-made cars, microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he later delayed most of them.\n\nHe has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with, saying broad “reciprocal” import taxes are coming April 2nd and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods.\n\nDartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said Trump advocating for modern tariffs by pointing to the 1890s is flawed.\n\n“We did grow rapidly in the late 19th century,” he said. “But it’s a stretch to attribute it to tariffs.”\n\n“The president is more accurate when he paints with a broader brush and says, ’Look, this entire period with fiscal surpluses we grew rapidly.’ That’s true of this 40-year period,” added Irwin, author of “Clashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.”\n\n“But, when you dig down to the details and say, ‘We raised tariffs in this instance,’ that’s where things go awry. Or the story doesn’t quite hold together as well,” Irwin said.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 things to know about tariffs and how they work\n\nWas America really at its wealthiest from 1870 to 1913?\n\nThe Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans. The name comes from a 1873 novel, co-written by Mark Twain, which satirized the greed and deceit of the era’s government and politicians.\n\nMany contemporary leaders were openly influenced by the famed robber barons, builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked.\n\nRockefeller became the exemplar of the era when his Standard Oil empire made him the world’s first billionaire. Morgan was an investment banker and legendary financier of industrial interests. Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed a breathtaking fortune through shipping and railroads, while steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was also a dedicated philanthropist who argued the rich had a moral responsibility to use their wealth to better a deeply unequal society.\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913, though there were dips and recessions, too.\n\nSome historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output. New industries like steel, electricity and petrochemicals boomed, as did sectors including construction and machinery.\n\nBut White said those years were marked by erratic economic growth, and those upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce. Indeed, the number of U.S. residents jumped from 38.5 million-plus in 1870 to more than 106 million by 1920.\n\nAnother factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west. That meant exploiting natural resources along the way — including gold, silver, timber, grazing and farmland, as well as coal, copper and oil, especially after the discovery of the Spindletop geyser in Texas in 1901.\n\nAverage wages rose, but so did inequality, with almost no social safety net. Working conditions were often so abhorrent, meanwhile, that the labor movement began gaining strength, as did progressive politicians clamoring for breaking up monopolies.\n\n“This is the height of antimonopoly, political turmoil, the rise of labor in the United States,” said White, author of “The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896.” “And the reason was, people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy.”\n\nIn fact, despite the growth, standards of living fell, including life expectancy and key health indicators, White said.\n\nCould tariffs replace the federal income tax?\n\nThe modern federal income tax came into fruition with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can’t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget in almost incalculable ways.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the federal government collected about $4 trillion in individual income tax and tax withholdings, according to the Treasury Department, compared with customs duties accounting for around $76.4 billion.\n\nBut the president nonetheless signed a Day 1 executive order calling for the creation of the External Revenue Service to “collect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Trump’s goal there was “to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay.”\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove, author of “The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters,” has defended the notion of low, reciprocal tariffs on U.S. foreign trading partners.\n\nBut Rove also says that tariffs can’t realistically replace a federal income tax. He noted in a February op-ed that from 1863 to 1913 tariffs brought in nearly half the U.S. government’s revenue but last year they accounted for less than 2% of federal revenue.\n\nWhy does Trump so revere McKinley?\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump called McKinley a “great president” and “natural business man,” who he said “made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” Hours later, he signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America’s tallest peak Mount McKinley.\n\nBut today’s economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley’s time.\n\nGlobal communication is now virtually instantaneous. Back then, communication was cumbersome and products were often fully assembled before being exported. Shipping could take months. Today’s goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled that are sourced all over the world and then built in places different from where they are ultimately sold.\n\nThe disruption of such carefully calibrated, multinational logistical systems by the coronavirus pandemic was a key reason why everything from leather couches to flooring to microchips for new cars suddenly became scarce. And that helped feed record inflation beginning in 2021 that continues to dog the U.S. economy today.\n\nRobert W. Merry, author of “President McKinley: Architect of the American Century,” said McKinley was the leading voice on tariffs at a time when they dominated policy discussions because they were the federal government’s chief source of revenue, given that no income tax existed.\n\nBut Trump differs with McKinley in using tariffs as a “bludgeon to get other countries to do our bidding on efforts that have nothing to do with revenue, or economic matters or trade.” The president has done that with Canada and Mexico, using tariff threats to try to force those countries to take harder lines against drug smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\n“Nobody would have even considered such a thing in McKinley’s day,” Merry said.\n\nMcKinley champions the Tariff Act of 1890\n\nMcKinley hailed from Canton, in northeast Ohio and was son of an iron foundries owner who was especially sensitive to overseas competition. He won a seat in Congress representing a steel-producing district and so promoted tariffs that one humor magazine used a cartoon on its cover to unflatteringly dub him the “Napoleon of Protectionism.”\n\nAs chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which set the then-highest import tax in U.S. history, raising taxes to 49.5% on 1,500-plus items — everything from glass to tin plates to cayenne pepper. The results were quickly poor for the economy and for Republicans.\n\n“It led to an increase in prices, a kind of inflation, even before the bill took effect,” Merry said. “The argument was, it was carte blanche for retailers and industrialists who basically jacked up their prices unnecessarily.”\n\nAmericans dealt Republicans landslide congressional defeats during the 1890 midterms, voting scores of incumbents out of office — including McKinley. The tariff fallout also helped Grover Cleveland win the White House for Democrats in 1892, after he lost his reelection the previous cycle.\n\nMcKinley rebounded, though. He was elected Ohio governor and eventually won the presidency in 1896 on a campaign slogan Trump has repeated: “I am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform.” His campaign also got boosts from big donations by major industrialists like Rockefeller, who were strongly opposed to McKinley’s populist Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan.\n\nJust as in McKinley’s time, today’s business titans have worked to ingratiate themselves to Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among the technology leaders who traveled to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, was already a fixture, before Inauguration Day.\n\nMeta, Google and Microsoft joined other major firms donating $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, while Amazon Prime Video is set to distribute a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Some business interests are hoping Trump will usher in a new era of antitrust, in which the government does less to block highly profitable corporate consolidation.\n\nWhat was the ‘great tariff commission’?\n\nIgnoring some of the political problems tariffs created for Republicans in his favored era, Trump instead has focused on repeating how import taxes after the Civil War helped the U.S. pay off debts it incurred during the fighting — and eventually achieve government budget surpluses.\n\nFrom 1866 to 1893, the U.S. ran nearly three straight decades of budget surpluses, fueled largely by tariffs and high domestic taxes on things like alcohol and tobacco, as well as the sale of federal lands. Paying down debt helped lower interest rates.\n\nTrump has even begun trumpeting what he calls the “great tariff commission of 1887,” which the president says was tasked with helping the government spend all those surpluses.\n\nIrwin said there was a tariff commission, but it was actually convened five years earlier in 1882. It also recommended reducing tariffs, which Congress didn’t do.\n\n“It’s hard to say it was a political success. It’s hard to say it was an economic success,” Irwin said. “Because we spent a lot of the 1890s with double digit unemployment.”\n\nThat’s because federal budget surpluses eventually began to effectively decrease the U.S. money supply and cause deflation. Meanwhile, higher tariffs increased the cost of living for many Americans, which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893.\n\nThat resulted in railroad bankruptcies, a stock market crash and a crushing recession in which unemployment reached 25% nationally. Then-President Cleveland’s lack of solutions was a key factor in voters turning on him and the Democrats and toward McKinley three years later.\n\nMcKinley also differed with Trump on key issues\n\nTrump has used his opening weeks back in office to champion U.S. expansionism in ways unseen in the modern era.\n\nHe’s refused to rule out U.S. military forces seizing back control of the Panama Canal and suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, making Canada the 51st state and even working with Israel to put American developers in charge of turning the Gaza Strip into a seaside “Riviera.”\n\nThere are echoes of McKinley there, because, as president, he moved to expand the reach of the U.S. The Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico became American territories as part of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in December 1898.\n\nBut the comparison is not so easy. McKinley was also skeptical of U.S. expansionism, even writing himself a note at the start of the war and carrying it as a reminder, Merry said.\n\n“While we are conducting war, and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get,” the note said. “When the war is over, we must keep what we want.”\n\nShortly after winning reelection in 1900, meanwhile, McKinley began rethinking tariffs, as a stronger and still-growing U.S. manufacturing base made him more appreciative of foreign markets.\n\n“McKinley began to see that, if we were going to be able to sell our goods overseas — as we were going to need to do because we would have more goods than we’d have a market for — we were going to have to accept goods as well,” Merry said.\n\nHe said that McKinley gave a speech in Buffalo, New York, outlining “this concept of reciprocity, which was: I’m prepared to bring down tariffs. Even me. Even William McKinley.”\n\n“That was his first big initiative after being reelected,” Merry said.\n\nIn that speech on Sept. 5, 1901, McKinley said, “A policy of goodwill and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not.”\n\nTrump is now promising that similar, reciprocal tariffs will take effect next month. But actually successfully pulling that off will be another difference from McKinley, who never got the chance.\n\nThe day after his Buffalo speech, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. He died on Sept. 14, 1901.",

        "ori_content": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) — In President Donald Trump ’ s idealized framing , the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s , when top hats and shirtwaists were fashionable and typhoid fever often killed more soldiers than combat . It was the Gilded Age , a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system , when poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth , like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan , held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped boost their financial empires . “ We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913 . That ’ s when we were a tariff country . And then they went to an income tax concept , ” Trump said days after taking office . “ It ’ s fine . It ’ s OK . But it would have been very much better. ” The desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump ’ s fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation ’ s 25th president , William McKinley , a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901 . Though Trump ’ s early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent — with him imposing them , then pulling many back — he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism . There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country ’ s foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax . READ MORE : Trump doesn ’ t rule out recession while downplaying business concerns about his tariffs Experts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption , social turmoil and inequality . They argue he ’ s also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods . And Gilded Age policies , they maintain , have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized , modern economy . “ The most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy — except for the very rich — wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy , ” said Richard White , a history professor emeritus at Stanford University . Trump says high tariffs and low interest rates , like those the U.S. had after the Civil War , can hastily pay down today ’ s federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S. It ’ s not a new theme for him . “ I am a Tariff Man , ” Trump declared in a 2018 online post . Campaigning for a second term last fall , Trump said of the McKinley era , “ We were a very wealthy country , and we ’ re going to be doing that now. ” Today , he says “ tariff ” is his favorite word and represents “ a very powerful weapon that politicians haven ’ t used because they were either dishonest , stupid or paid off in some other form. ” The White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising that import levies will soon increase on the European Union , as well as new , foreign-made cars , microchips and pharmaceuticals . Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico , though he later delayed most of them . He has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with , saying broad “ reciprocal ” import taxes are coming April 2nd and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods . Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said Trump advocating for modern tariffs by pointing to the 1890s is flawed . “ We did grow rapidly in the late 19th century , ” he said . “ But it ’ s a stretch to attribute it to tariffs. ” “ The president is more accurate when he paints with a broader brush and says , ’ Look , this entire period with fiscal surpluses we grew rapidly. ’ That ’ s true of this 40-year period , ” added Irwin , author of “ Clashing over Commerce : A History of U.S. Trade Policy. ” “ But , when you dig down to the details and say , ‘ We raised tariffs in this instance , ’ that ’ s where things go awry . Or the story doesn ’ t quite hold together as well , ” Irwin said . READ MORE : 5 things to know about tariffs and how they work Was America really at its wealthiest from 1870 to 1913 ? The Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans . The name comes from a 1873 novel , co-written by Mark Twain , which satirized the greed and deceit of the era ’ s government and politicians . Many contemporary leaders were openly influenced by the famed robber barons , builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked . Rockefeller became the exemplar of the era when his Standard Oil empire made him the world ’ s first billionaire . Morgan was an investment banker and legendary financier of industrial interests . Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed a breathtaking fortune through shipping and railroads , while steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was also a dedicated philanthropist who argued the rich had a moral responsibility to use their wealth to better a deeply unequal society . Overall , the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913 , though there were dips and recessions , too . Some historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output . New industries like steel , electricity and petrochemicals boomed , as did sectors including construction and machinery . But White said those years were marked by erratic economic growth , and those upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce . Indeed , the number of U.S. residents jumped from 38.5 million-plus in 1870 to more than 106 million by 1920 . Another factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west . That meant exploiting natural resources along the way — including gold , silver , timber , grazing and farmland , as well as coal , copper and oil , especially after the discovery of the Spindletop geyser in Texas in 1901 . Average wages rose , but so did inequality , with almost no social safety net . Working conditions were often so abhorrent , meanwhile , that the labor movement began gaining strength , as did progressive politicians clamoring for breaking up monopolies . “ This is the height of antimonopoly , political turmoil , the rise of labor in the United States , ” said White , author of “ The Republic for Which it Stands : The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age , 1865-1896. ” “ And the reason was , people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy. ” In fact , despite the growth , standards of living fell , including life expectancy and key health indicators , White said . Could tariffs replace the federal income tax ? The modern federal income tax came into fruition with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913 , ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest . He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House , and he can ’ t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget in almost incalculable ways . In fiscal year 2024 , the federal government collected about $ 4 trillion in individual income tax and tax withholdings , according to the Treasury Department , compared with customs duties accounting for around $ 76.4 billion . But the president nonetheless signed a Day 1 executive order calling for the creation of the External Revenue Service to “ collect tariffs , duties , and other foreign trade-related revenues. ” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Trump ’ s goal there was “ to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay. ” Republican strategist Karl Rove , author of “ The Triumph of William McKinley : Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters , ” has defended the notion of low , reciprocal tariffs on U.S. foreign trading partners . But Rove also says that tariffs can ’ t realistically replace a federal income tax . He noted in a February op-ed that from 1863 to 1913 tariffs brought in nearly half the U.S. government ’ s revenue but last year they accounted for less than 2 % of federal revenue . Why does Trump so revere McKinley ? In his inaugural address , Trump called McKinley a “ great president ” and “ natural business man , ” who he said “ made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. ” Hours later , he signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America ’ s tallest peak Mount McKinley . But today ’ s economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley ’ s time . Global communication is now virtually instantaneous . Back then , communication was cumbersome and products were often fully assembled before being exported . Shipping could take months . Today ’ s goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled that are sourced all over the world and then built in places different from where they are ultimately sold . The disruption of such carefully calibrated , multinational logistical systems by the coronavirus pandemic was a key reason why everything from leather couches to flooring to microchips for new cars suddenly became scarce . And that helped feed record inflation beginning in 2021 that continues to dog the U.S. economy today . Robert W. Merry , author of “ President McKinley : Architect of the American Century , ” said McKinley was the leading voice on tariffs at a time when they dominated policy discussions because they were the federal government ’ s chief source of revenue , given that no income tax existed .

The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war."

The company, a key software contractor to the U.S. Government, has seen its shares come under significant pressure in recent weeks after a report surfaced last month that the Pentagon plans a reduction in military spending. More recently, broader selling across tech stocks amid tariff uncertainty and talk of a potential recession have dented investor confidence. Still, some analysts remain bullish on Palantir’s outlook, arguing that the company’s suite of AI-powered analytics software places it in a position to benefit from efforts by the Trump White House to improve government efficiency. Palantir shares rose 2.2% to close at $78.05 on Tuesday, rebounding from the previous session's 10% decline. The stock has fallen 38% since hitting a record high three weeks ago, but the price is still three times what it was a year ago. After a bearish engulfing pattern signaled a record high in the stock last month, Palantir shares have moved lower on increasing trading volume, with bearish price action continuing into this week. Source: TradingView.com. Despite the recent decline, the relative strength index (RSI) index remains above the key 50 threshold and sits in a location that has generally corresponded with the low of several key retracements on the chart dating back to early 2023. Investors should watch crucial support levels on Palantir's chart around $66, $44 and $30, while also monitoring important overhead areas near $85 and $121.

Ivan Romano / Getty Images Viking reported solid Q4 results, with revenue of $1.35 billion, in line with Visible Alpha estimates. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents surpassed expectations. As of Feb. 23, the company had recorded $5.3 billion in advance bookings year-to-date for 2025, up 26% year-over-year. \"These are very good trends for 2025,\" Viking CEO Tor Hagen said on the call. \"I will highlight that depending on the market conditions we might not want to be booked too far out as we look to optimize pricing.\" Viking shares closed 6.1% lower on Tuesday. The stock is still up 67% from the company's initial public offering price of $24 last spring.\n\n-Aaron Rennie\n\nAsana Plunges as CEO Moskowitz Steps Down Shares of Asana (ASAN) lost nearly a quarter of their value on Tuesday following news CEO Dustin Moskovitz would step down, as the work management platform provider gave a weak fiscal 2026 outlook. The company announced late Monday that company co-founder Moskovitz has decided to leave as soon as a new CEO is named. Asana added that Moskovitz will continue as board chair and plans to retain his shares. The San Francisco-based Asana was founded 17 years ago by Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein, who met while both were leading engineering teams at Facebook, now part of Meta Platforms (META). The two came up with the idea of creating a technology that would make it easier for employees to coordinate their work. Along with the Moskovitz news, the company reported that it expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $782 million to $790 million, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $803.6 million. Asana shares closed 24% lower at $12.64 on Tuesday. The stock, which started trading in 2020, is a far cry from its late-2021 record high of around $145. -Bill McColl\n\nAI Stocks Rebound with 'Fundamentals Still Intact' Many of the biggest AI investor plays rebounded on Tuesday. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, up 10.7%. Several other popular AI stocks were among the day’s best performers, including nuclear power provider Vistra (VST), up 5.4%, and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), up 1.7%. AI stocks may have found some support on Tuesday by investors willing to buy the dip after a dramatic pullback. Shares of AI software company Palantir (PLTR) lost about 40% of their value between hitting a record high in mid-February and yesterday’s close. The stock rebounded 4% today. Applovin (APP), which surged more than 700% last year on AI-fueled growth, was down more than 50% from its mid-February record high before rebounding about 8% today. Tesla (TSLA), which tumbled 15% yesterday to close 53% off its post-election high, advanced nearly 4% on Tuesday. Sky-high valuations were one major reason AI stocks have been hit particularly hard by the tariff sell-off. But the AI trade had already lost momentum before Trump’s tariffs shook the broader stock market. Concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure, slowing growth at AI bellwether Nvidia, and competition from Chinese competitors led the AI rally to stall in late January and early February. UBS analysts in a note on Tuesday expressed optimism that the current sell-off will play out like a similar rout in 2018. The analysts argued that the tech slump during Trump's first term, in which geopolitics and “fundamentals-related noise” briefly clouded investors’ view of an otherwise strong outlook, resembles today’s. There are risks around escalating trade wars, the analysts note. “But with AI fundamentals still intact, investors should not lose sight of the long-term risk-reward and should take advantage of extreme volatility through buying-the-dip in quality AI stocks and structured strategies.” -Colin Laidley\n\nInvestors are Watching This Key Indicator as S&P 500 Slumps The S&P 500 on Monday fell below its 200-day moving average—a \"key technical indicator\" and gauge of market momentum—for the first time since 2023. An index crossing below its 200-day moving average can reflect either short-term volatility or the beginning of a prolonged slump. Citi analysts wrote in a recent note that falling stocks and economic uncertainty could encourage companies to put cash toward stock buybacks rather than capital investments, potentially offering support to stock prices. Read the full article here. -Colin Laidley\n\nTesla Surges After Sell-Off Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped Tuesday, after losing more than 15% of their value a day earlier. The stock was up 5% at around $233 in late trading, making back a small fraction of what it’s lost amid an extended sell-off since President Trump took office. The stock is on pace to fall for the eighth consecutive week, even after the uptick on Tuesday. TradingView Tesla's stock price had surged to a record close of $479.86 about a month after Trump’s election victory, but since Musk started working in the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency in January, the EV maker's shares have lost almost half their value. Recent losses have come amid worries about slowing sales in China and declining registrations in Europe, as well as widespread market uncertainty about tariffs. However, Tesla’s precipitous slide could be an opportunity for investors to buy low, analysts at Morgan Stanley told clients Monday. The analysts reiterated a price target of $430, calling Tesla its “top pick” among U.S. automakers, bolstered by artificial intelligence and robotics potential. The consensus price target for Tesla stock is about $366 among analysts who follow Tesla and are tracked by Visible Alpha. -Andrew Kessel\n\nSmall Business Owners' Confidence Drops as Uncertainty Rises Small business owners, who largely cheered Donald Trump's election, are starting to feel uncertain about the future amid the president's rapid policy changes.\n\n\n\nOptimism among small businesses fell in February, according to a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses released Tuesday. An index measuring uncertainty rose to its second-highest level in the survey's 50-year history. Despite the downtick, business optimism remained above its historical average. Small businesses have historically applauded Trump and his policies. The confidence index hit what at the time was its highest point ever in 2016, the first time Trump was elected. And after Trump won re-election last year, the index surged. The survey highlighted the uncertainty taking hold in the business community. Trump's on-again, off-again threats to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners have made planning for the future cloudier and raised concerns about rising costs and inflation reigniting. Business owners are responding to the developments by raising prices, according to the survey. The net percentage of businesses raising prices rose 10 percentage points to 32%, the biggest jump since 2021, and the third-highest level on record.\n\n\n\n\"Although economic perceptions remain much more constructive than in recent years, the recent flurry of tariff activity appears to have dented economic expectations and put upward pressure on small business prices,\" Charlie Dougherty, Jackie Benson, and Ali Hajibeigi, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary. -Diccon Hyatt\n\nAirlines Scale Back Outlooks as Demand Softens Three of the largest U.S. airlines—Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and American Airlines (AAL)—have lowered their projections for the first quarter of the year, citing weakening travel demand amid an uncertain economy. Delta said it expects first-quarter revenue to rise 3% to 4% rather than the 7% to 9% growth it projected previously, citing a \"recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in Domestic demand.\" Southwest and American Airlines have also cut their revenue outlooks. American projected a larger loss than previously expected and Southwest announced a slate of new revenue-generating measures like charging for checked luggage. American cited \"softness in the domestic leisure segment\" along with a negative impact on bookings after the January Washington, D.C., crash involving one of its planes. Southwest cited the impact of the January wildfires in Los Angeles—but also \"softness in bookings and demand trends as the macro environment has weakened.\" The trend is also hitting smaller airlines. JetBlue (JBLU) lowered its first-quarter projection for available seat miles because of more weather disruptions and \"demand choppiness due to mixed macroeconomic indicators.\" \"We believe airline industry demand will likely bounce along the trough until macro stability is reached,\" Bank of America analysts wrote Monday. -Aaron McDade\n\nTeradyne Plunges as Company Warns on Impact of Tariffs Shares of Teradyne (TER) plummeted to lead S&P 500 decliners Tuesday, as the maker of testing equipment for chips and electronics updated its guidance in response to the potential impact of Trump administration trade moves. In a presentation ahead of its Investor Day, the company said that it sees short-term volatility \"mainly in SemiTest business,\" as well as new uncertainty around tariffs and trade restrictions. It added it doesn’t expect cancellations, \"but some push outs and capital reviews.\" Teradyne didn't forecast any changes to its outlook for the current quarter but anticipates second-quarter revenue to be flat to down 10% from the first quarter and full-year revenue up 5% to 10% year-over-year. For fiscal 2026, the company predicts earnings per share (EPS) and revenue \"trending toward the low end of the previous 2026 earnings model.\" In addition to the update, Teradyne also announced it bought privately held Quantifi Photonics for an undisclosed price. Quantifi manufactures photonic integrated circuit testing devices. TradingView Teradyne shares, which entered Tuesday little changed over the past year, were down 18% in recent trading, at their lowest level in more than a year.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Jumps After News of Baggage Fees Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares surged Tuesday after the airline announced its latest revenue-generating changes amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. The airline said it would introduce a basic economy ticket option and baggage fees, ending some of Southwest's trademark perks. Certain members of the airline's rewards program will still be eligible for one or two free checked bags once the policy changes for flights booked on or after May 28. The introduction of baggage fees are the newest change for Southwest, which in July announced an end to its famed open seating policy and introduced overnight flights, which started last month. The airline has since said it plans to start booking assigned seating flights in the second half of this year and roll out the changes in 2026. “What’s changed is that we’ve come to realize that we need more revenue to cover our costs,” Southwest COO Andrew Watterson told CNBC Tuesday. “We think that these changes that we’re announcing today will lead to less of that share shift than would have been the case otherwise.\" The changes follow months of disputes with Elliott, which built a stake in Southwest last year and pushed for changes at the executive and board level. In October, the sides agreed to a settlement that saw five Elliott-backed candidates added to Southwest's board. Also on Tuesday, Southwest lowered its projected growth for first-quarter revenue per available seat mile to a year-over-year increase of 2% to 4%, from 5% to 7% previously. TradingView Southwest shares were up more than 6% in recent trading. Despite Tuesday's gains, they've lost about 10% of their value since the start of the year. -Aaron McDade\n\nKohl's Stock Plunges on Disappointing Outlook Shares of Kohl's (KSS) plunged in early trading after the struggling retailer's forecasts fell short of analysts' expectations. For fiscal 2025, Kohl's projects net sales to fall 5% to 7%, comparable sales to fall 4% to 6%, and earnings per share (EPS) of between $0.10 and $0.60. Analysts were looking for 2025 net sales to decline by about 2%, comparable sales to decline by 1.83%, and EPS of $1.26, according to Visible Alpha data. The department store chain's fiscal fourth-quarter results were mixed, with profits lagging analysts' projections. It posted EPS of $0.43 on net revenue of $5.4 billion. (After adjusting for one-time costs like store closures, Kohl's adjusted EPS of $0.95 topped estimates.) Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.71 and $5.38 billion, respectively. Last year, Kohl's registered profit of $1.67 per share and sales of $5.96 billion. Comparable store sales fell by 6.7%, a bit better than the 6.9% decline that analysts had projected. Kohl's missed estimates last quarter, when its said craft store chain Michaels Cos. CEO Ashley Buchanan would be replacing Tom Kingsbury as chief executive. TradingView Kohl's shares were down 15% in recent trading and have lost more than 60% of their value over the past year. The stock dipped below $10 for the first time since 1997 this morning. -Aaron McDade\n\nTesla Prices to Watch After Stock's 50% Decline from Record Tesla (TSLA) shares moved slightly higher in premarket trading after tumbling 15% on Monday to lead S&P decliners, closing below their Election Day level for the first time. Since hitting a record high in mid-December, Tesla shares have fallen 55% amid investor concerns about potential fallout from Musk's extensive involvement in the Trump administration and weak sales figures. Tesla shares fell below the closely watched 200-week moving average in Monday’s trading session. Moreover, increasing volumes have accompanied the recent drop, signaling selling participation by larger market players, such as institutional investors and hedge funds. Source: TradingView.com. While the relative strength index confirms bearish momentum with a reading below 50, the indicator has moved into a region that has typically corresponded with bounces in the stock stretching back to May 2022. Investors should monitor key support levels on Tesla's chart around $215 and $165, while also watching major resistance levels near $265 and $300. The stock was up 0.4% at $223 in recent premarket trading. Read the full technical analysis piece here. -Timothy Smith",

The net percentage of businesses raising prices rose 10 percentage points to 32 % , the biggest jump since 2021 , and the third-highest level on record . `` Although economic perceptions remain much more constructive than in recent years , the recent flurry of tariff activity appears to have dented economic expectations and put upward pressure on small business prices , '' Charlie Dougherty , Jackie Benson , and Ali Hajibeigi , economists at Wells Fargo Securities , wrote in a commentary . -Diccon Hyatt Airlines Scale Back Outlooks as Demand Softens Three of the largest U.S. airlines—Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) , Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) , and American Airlines ( AAL ) —have lowered their projections for the first quarter of the year , citing weakening travel demand amid an uncertain economy . Delta said it expects first-quarter revenue to rise 3 % to 4 % rather than the 7 % to 9 % growth it projected previously , citing a `` recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty , driving softness in Domestic demand .

        "content": "the new new world\n\nAs the United States grapples with the upheaval unleashed by the Trump administration, many Chinese people are finding they can relate to what many Americans are going through.\n\nThey are saying it feels something like the Cultural Revolution, the period known as “the decade of turmoil.” The young aides Elon Musk has sent to dismantle the U.S. government reminded some Chinese of the Red Guards whom Mao Zedong enlisted to destroy the bureaucracy at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. Upon hearing President Trump’s musing about serving a third term, they joked that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, must be saying, “I know how to do it” — he secured one in 2022 by engineering a constitutional change.\n\nThe United States helped China modernize and expand its economy in the hope that China would become more like America — more democratic and more open. Now for some Chinese, the United States is looking more and more like China.\n\n“Coming from an authoritarian state, we know that dictatorship is not just a system — it is, at its core, the pursuit of power,” Wang Jian, a journalist, wrote in an X post criticizing Mr. Trump. “We also know that the Cultural Revolution was about dismantling institutions to expand control.”\n\nFor these Chinese, who strive for democratic values but contend with an authoritarian state, their role model is tearing itself down. They are expressing their alarm in interviews, articles and social media comments that range in emotion from disappointment and anger to sardonic.\n\n“Beacon of democracy, 1776-2025,” wrote a commenter on a post by the official Weibo social media account of the U.S. Embassy in China.\n\nThey’re witnessing things they thought could happen only in China: sycophantic official announcements, intimidation of the media and top entrepreneurs vying for favor from the leadership, not to mention a president who calls himself a king.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity — it feels so much like China,” Zhang Wenmin, an investigative journalist known by her pen name, Jiang Xue, told me. Ms. Zhang was forced to leave China because of her work and moved to the United States in 2023. “I’ve just gotten out of the frying pan and into the fire,” she said.\n\nOf course, the two countries are fundamentally different.\n\nChina is a one-party state lacking in three pillars of the American system: liberty, democracy and the rule of law. Millions of Chinese died during the Cultural Revolution, and tens of millions were persecuted. What’s happening in the United States is far from that. “It’s not exactly parallel,” Ian Johnson, an American journalist who has been writing about China for decades, told me. “But historical parallels are never exact because history doesn’t really repeat itself.” The American system is tearing itself apart with no outside pressure, he said, and this is similar to what the Communist Party did at the peak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, which destroyed nearly all institutions in China, the country tried to build something like those American foundations. Despite official restrictions, lawyers, journalists and entrepreneurs built a budding civil society that tried to hold the government accountable.\n\nThese are the Chinese who suffered the most when Mr. Xi smothered efforts to make China a more open and democratic society, and they’re also the most disappointed at what’s happening in the United States.\n\nThey have been shocked by the abrupt changes in U.S. policy under President Trump. Most striking is the language government agencies have used in social media postings. The tone, people say, sounds like Chinese Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“Even the CCP’s embassy posts, with all its propaganda, doesn’t spend every single day obsessively praising Xi Jinping,” Deng Haiyan, a former police officer turned critic of the Chinese government, wrote on X.\n\n“You’d think People’s Daily had moved into the U.S. Consulate,” he wrote, referring to the official newspaper for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe official Weibo account of the U.S. Embassy in China, which has 3.5 million followers, used to be a platform for the U.S. government to spread American values and reliable information. Chinese who share those values would sometimes use the comment sections of the account to vent about their own government.\n\nR. Nicholas Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador in China until January, talked about the importance of using social media to interact with the Chinese public. “One of the major preoccupations of our mission,” he said in a speech in 2023, “is to try to tell the truth about American society, American history, U.S.-China relations to the Chinese people.”\n\nThat truth telling, he added, was meant to counter a distorted version of the United States from the Chinese official media. The Weibo account was intended as a Chinese-language bulletin board about American values.\n\nImage Mao Zedong with Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, in 1966. Credit... Universal History Archive/UIG, via Getty Images\n\nIn the past month, many of the embassy’s Weibo posts, which overlap with some of the posts on its X account, were flooded with angry comments from Chinese users expressing disappointment.\n\n“Shame on you!” many Weibo users with IP addresses in China commented on posts about the U.S. policies toward Ukraine.\n\nOn a post about remarks Mr. Trump made about human rights, one user wrote: “And you think you’re worthy of talking about human rights? You betrayed Ukraine!”\n\nThe changes of both content and style on the Weibo account led one commenter to tease the account’s social media editor: “Blink twice if you’ve been kidnapped.” The embassy press office declined to comment.\n\nFor many Chinese, the chaos in Washington is driven by a familiar impulse.\n\n“The only way to dismantle America’s ‘deep state’ is through a ‘Cultural Revolution,’” Zhang Qianfan, a professor of law at Peking University, wrote in a widely circulated article about the erosion of American democracy. “The Cultural Revolution brings neither honesty nor efficiency — only the demolition of the rule of law essential to everyone’s survival.”\n\nThe characteristics of authoritarian leaders, such as surrounding themselves with loyalists and trying to control the media, are not unique to China.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao promoted a semiliterate peasant to the office of vice premier and a low-level cadre at a textile mill to be his deputy at the age of 38.\n\nFor his third term, Mr. Xi has surrounded himself with loyalists, many of whom did not go to elite Chinese universities. Neither do they have lengthy experience working in the central government, unlike members of the previous two Chinese administrations.\n\nLast week, when the U.S. Embassy in China posted on its Weibo account that the White House would pick the media outlets allowed to participate in the presidential press pool, a user in the southwestern city Chongqing commented, “Selectively allowing certain media outlets to conduct interviews — such a familiar tactic.”\n\nFor Chinese, one of the most astonishing aspects is how fast Mr. Trump seems to be building a cult of personality.\n\nAfter he showed off hats that said “Trump was right about everything,” a user on X wrote in Chinese: “Mao Zedong of America has been born! Long live the great leader Chairman Trump — long live, long live, long long live!”\n\nLi Weiao, a Beijing-based journalist, posted a video clip on Weibo that shows Mr. Trump enjoying a standing ovation at his first cabinet meeting in his second term. “I think I truly underestimated the dark side of human nature,” he wrote on Weibo.\n\n“The rhythm of this applause feels so familiar,” a lawyer commented on Mr. Li’s post. Another commenter wrote: “Just like North Korea and its friend,” referring to China.\n\nIn a comment on an episode of my Chinese-language podcast, a YouTube viewer wrote a parody of a White House announcement in the style of Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“The entire Republican Party and all of America must unite even more closely around the White House Central Committee with President Trump at its core, holding high the great banner of American-style capitalism,” the user wrote. “We must fully implement Trump’s New Era American Capitalism Thought, stay united in purpose, uphold tradition while innovating, forge ahead with determination, and fight tirelessly to achieve the great MAGA goal!”",

But, as we straw-polled Donald Trump supporters on our travels, it was frequently cited as their top vote motivator.\n\nNow, eight weeks into Trump's presidency, talk about \"the economy\" is dominated by words like \"chaos\", \"uncertainty\" and a possible \"recession\".\n\nTeam Trump prefers euphemisms like \"transition\", \"disturbance\" and \"detox\", and argues any short-term pain will lead to long-term gain.\n\nBut the indices that measure business certainty, investor confidence and market stability are flying off the charts in the wrong direction.\n\nThis is the direct result of Trump's backwards-and-forwards tariffs policy.\n\nAs the US president slams hefty taxes on imports and constantly threatens more, goading long-time partners and allies into ugly fights, a global trade war is erupting.\n\nIt's America versus the world.\n\n## Two types of tariffs\n\nTrump is using tariffs for two different purposes.\n\nThe first type of tariff is designed to advance his \"America First\" trade policy.\n\nThese tariffs are fiscal levers. Traditional protectionist measures to disadvantage foreign producers and stimulate local manufacturing.\n\nThe tariffs placed on aluminium and steel, which angered Australia this week, fit into this category.\n\nLoading...The second type of tariff is designed to pressure world leaders to bend to Trump's will.\n\nRather than fiscal levers, these tariffs are bargaining chips — or, in some cases, bludgeoning clubs.\n\nAn example is Trump's snap decision to slap tariffs on Colombia.\n\nWhen that country's president refused to accept military plane-loads of handcuffed deportees, Trump said he was immediately imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Colombian imports, with more to come.\n\nColombia's president talked tough, but up against the threat of a crippled national economy, he ultimately relented.\n\n## Trade power plays\n\nSome of the tariffs appear to straddle both categories. It's not always clear what is protectionism, and what is power playing.\n\nThat could be said of the tariffs on America's biggest trading partners — China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump has complained about uneven trade relationships with those countries, and talked about tariffs as a way to reverse the deficits.\n\nBut most of his rhetoric, and the official White House orders, say he's using those tariffs to force the three countries to do more about fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\nWhen they were imposed, China responded with retaliatory tariffs. But Canada and Mexico played ball, announcing measures to toughen up border controls.\n\nSo Trump postponed their tariffs — then implemented them (with some exclusions) a month later, and told both countries to expect more.\n\nCanada's now accusing him of using the tariffs to cripple its economy to a point where the US could take over the country.\n\nIndeed, Trump posted this week: \"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished fifty-first state.\"\n\nLoading...His treatment of Canada has led to sweeping retaliatory tariffs that will hurt American exporters.\n\nChina's revenge tariffs on meat, grains and fruit won't be good for stateside farmers.\n\nMexico says it will retaliate too, but its plans aren't yet clear.\n\n## A bruising battle\n\nIn this America-versus-the-world trade war, much of the world is aggressively fighting back.\n\nAnd in the US, the bruises are becoming visible.\n\nIn response to widespread investor uncertainty and tariff-fuelled fears of recession, American stocks have tanked (dragging Australia's down with them).\n\nFor American consumers, the cost-of-living impacts are coming into view too.\n\nSome breweries, for example, are talking about having to increase their prices to cover costlier cans made from imported aluminium.\n\nThat's small beer, though, compared to the price increases on European alcohol if Trump follows through on his threat of 200 per cent tariffs on drinks from the European Union (EU) — a response to the EU's retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey.\n\nOf course, the cost increases caused by tariffs will be felt well beyond bars and bottle shops.\n\nThe metal tariffs alone have prompted warnings of price increases from industries ranging from car-making to construction.\n\n## Confidence crashes\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in November last year, there were celebrations among those Americans who told us they were worried about the economy.\n\nThe University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey — which measures how Americans feel about their finances and broader economic conditions — showed bumps in optimism in the couple of months after the election.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, though, the sentiment started to turn.\n\nThen on Friday, it crashed.\n\nThe fall to a score of 57.9 represents an 11 per cent drop in a month, to a level significantly lower than even the darkest days of COVID (but still higher than during points of rampant inflation in 2022 and 2023).\n\nOn this measure, a sizeable chunk of Americans look to be losing faith in the president they trusted to bring them boomtimes.\n\nLoading...Polls had already been reflecting widespread worries about hip-pocket hits.\n\nIn a Reuters/Ipsos poll, released on Wednesday, local time, 70 per cent of Americans said they expected tariffs would push up grocery costs and other consumer prices. Fifty-seven per cent felt his moves to shake up the economy were too erratic. Only 32 per cent approved of the job he was doing on cost-of-living issues.\n\nFor now, though, Trump is unfazed. He sees his tariffs fight as a longer-term project to right the world's wrongs and make things fairer for America.\n\nHis administration continues to argue — against the views of many economists — that the pros will outweigh the cons.\n\n\"We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore,\" Trump said earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm not going to bend at all.\"\n\nLoading",

But Canada and Mexico played ball, announcing measures to toughen up border controls.\n\nSo Trump postponed their tariffs — then implemented them (with some exclusions) a month later, and told both countries to expect more.\n\nCanada's now accusing him of using the tariffs to cripple its economy to a point where the US could take over the country.\n\nIndeed, Trump posted this week: \"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished fifty-first state.\"\n\nLoading...His treatment of Canada has led to sweeping retaliatory tariffs that will hurt American exporters.\n\nChina's revenge tariffs on meat, grains and fruit won't be good for stateside farmers.\n\nMexico says it will retaliate too, but its plans aren't yet clear.\n\n## A bruising battle\n\nIn this America-versus-the-world trade war, much of the world is aggressively fighting back.\n\nAnd in the US, the bruises are becoming visible.\n\nIn response to widespread investor uncertainty and tariff-fuelled fears of recession, American stocks have tanked (dragging Australia's down with them).\n\nFor American consumers, the cost-of-living impacts are coming into view too.\n\nSome breweries, for example, are talking about having to increase their prices to cover costlier cans made from imported aluminium.\n\nThat's small beer, though, compared to the price increases on European alcohol if Trump follows through on his threat of 200 per cent tariffs on drinks from the European Union (EU) — a response to the EU's retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey.\n\nOf course, the cost increases caused by tariffs will be felt well beyond bars and bottle shops.\n\nThe metal tariffs alone have prompted warnings of price increases from industries ranging from car-making to construction.\n\n## Confidence crashes\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in November last year, there were celebrations among those Americans who told us they were worried about the economy.\n\nThe University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey — which measures how Americans feel about their finances and broader economic conditions — showed bumps in optimism in the couple of months after the election.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, though, the sentiment started to turn.\n\nThen on Friday, it crashed.\n\nThe fall to a score of 57.9 represents an 11 per cent drop in a month, to a level significantly lower than even the darkest days of COVID (but still higher than during points of rampant inflation in 2022 and 2023).\n\nOn this measure, a sizeable chunk of Americans look to be losing faith in the president they trusted to bring them boomtimes.\n\nLoading...Polls had already been reflecting widespread worries about hip-pocket hits.\n\nIn a Reuters/Ipsos poll, released on Wednesday, local time, 70 per cent of Americans said they expected tariffs would push up grocery costs and other consumer prices. Fifty-seven per cent felt his moves to shake up the economy were too erratic. Only 32 per cent approved of the job he was doing on cost-of-living issues.\n\nFor now, though, Trump is unfazed. He sees his tariffs fight as a longer-term project to right the world's wrongs and make things fairer for America.\n\nHis administration continues to argue — against the views of many economists — that the pros will outweigh the cons.\n\n\"We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore,\" Trump said earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm not going to bend at all.\"\n\nLoading"

        "content": "Trump has frequently called out India as the world’s “ tariff king ,” and this is not far from the truth. India is a tariff outlier. If the renewed debate on protectionism helps India understand that its trade policies are self-defeating, Trump might end up doing India, and the world, a huge favor.\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump announced sweeping and unprecedented tariffs on U.S. trading partners, intensifying global economic uncertainty and triggering a sharp stock market decline in the United States and elsewhere. At the same time, China continues to face headwinds from the global “China+1” strategy, as countries seek to diversify their supply chains and reduce dependence on Chinese manufacturing—a concern that has grown with the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. India should seize this moment to set a bold new ambition: to become a more reliable trading partner to the world than either China or the United States. Its size and long-term potential lend credibility to such a vision. Realizing it, though, will require a fundamental rethinking and overhaul of India’s trade policy approach.\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump announced sweeping and unprecedented tariffs on U.S. trading partners, intensifying global economic uncertainty and triggering a sharp stock market decline in the United States and elsewhere.

India is a tariff outlier. If the renewed debate on protectionism helps India understand that its trade policies are self-defeating, Trump might end up doing India, and the world, a huge favor.\n\nTrump’s tariffs have been labeled by economist Paul Krugman as the “biggest trade shock in history.” Including all tariff changes announced as of mid-May, average effective tariffs in the United States—the world’s largest importing country—are calculated at 17.8 percent (assuming the share of countries in U.S. imports remains the same) or 16.4 percent (after assuming shifts in demand to lower tariff countries). The latter is the highest rate since 1937.\n\nThese actions are roiling the world economy, leading to retaliation by some partners—especially China—and pushing the rest of the world to find other sources of demand. This is, in turn, accelerating negotiations on trade partnerships that do not involve the United States. Most countries will also intensify efforts to preserve and reform the rules-based international trading system. Irrespective of how the future tariff landscape evolves, the “uncertainty tax” on business has dramatically increased since November 2024: A global index of economic uncertainty was already higher in January 2025 than at any time since 1997 and would certainly have increased further since then (and the International Monetary Fund says trade policy uncertainty is “off the charts”).\n\nWhile demand-side diversification strategies away from the United States are a recent phenomenon, efforts to diversify supply chains away from China have existed since the 2000s, gaining significant traction during the first round of the U.S.-China trade wars and during the COVID-19 pandemic. China has not helped its case by weaponizing trade to score political points: Examples include restricting rare-earth exports to Japan owing to contestation about the Senkaku Islands (which China calls the Diaoyu) and cutting demand from Australia after it called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19. China’s ongoing trade war, which has intensified further after it announced retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. levies, and a more general export control on rare earths also make countries wary of getting involved in the crossfire. Finally, China’s opaque export subsidies have made it a frequent target of anti-dumping duties and prompted efforts to find other supply sources.\n\nIt seems the stage is set for the world’s most populous country to take on a more prominent role in world trade. But India is being held back by a diffident approach to trade. Between 2015 and 2022, India’s simple average tariffs rose from 13.4 to 18.1 percent. Despite declining to 17 percent in 2023, its tariffs rates are significantly higher than those of countries with which it is competing for a share of the China+1 pie: Vietnam’s average tariff is 9.4 percent, and other Southeast Asian competitors fall in the 8-10 percent range. India’s elevated tariffs—particularly high on many final goods such as automobiles and apparel—raise costs for exporters and consumers and encourage firms to sell into the protected domestic market. High tariffs have also rendered India vulnerable to World Trade Organization complaints by partners.\n\nMoreover, after 2022, India has seen a spurt in quality control orders, or QCOs: quality standards that must be met by domestic and foreign producers. These QCOs, now covering more than 100 sectors, are often opaque, incentivize lobbying, and lead to significant delays in import clearances; economists call these “nontariff barriers.”\n\nThis rise in protection harks back to India’s past. After independence in 1947, India’s leaders opted for import substitution industrialization, a strategy based on high import protection—invoking the infant industry argument—and a leading role for the state in the “commanding heights” of the economy, such as capital goods and other core sectors such as steel, chemicals, and trucks. This economic nationalism was a reaction to the British Empire’s open economy approach and was nurtured for more than four decades by the Indian National Congress party, whose leaders led the independence struggle.\n\nBut the recent rise in import barriers—aimed at promoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” initiative and reviving a manufacturing sector in decline relative to the rest of the economy—ignores the lessons of India’s post-1991 economic success, when a macroeconomic crisis gave India’s policymakers the political space to liberalize onerous trade, industrial, financial, and foreign exchange policies. Average tariffs were steadily reduced from 81 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 1997 and 9 percent by 2010. The impact on trade was conspicuous: Goods trade rose from 11 percent of GDP in 1988 to a peak of 43 percent in 2012.\n\nIn the last decade, as Indian tariffs rose, Vietnam—a country with just 7 percent of India’s population—has become a serious competitor. It already exports more manufactured goods than its much larger Asian counterpart. Both countries import significant quantities of chemicals as production inputs. But Vietnam’s average import duty on chemicals is just 3 percent, compared with 10.3 percent in India. Moreover, more than 50 percent of chemicals enter Vietnam duty-free, whereas in India, this figure is a mere 0.2 percent. This pattern holds across other key inputs, meaning that Indian firms consistently pay higher costs for raw materials than Vietnamese competitors, making it significantly harder for them to compete in global markets.\n\nIndia’s tariff regime has also been a major roadblock in its efforts to secure comprehensive free trade agreements, or FTAs, with key trading partners. For example, its negotiations with the European Union, which began in 2007, have not yet reached a conclusion, largely due to disagreements over tariff reductions. While India has signed trade agreements with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, these are “early harvest” deals that fall short of the commitments found in comprehensive FTAs. The failure to secure comprehensive trade agreements has significant implications for India’s export growth. Vietnam, by contrast, has signed FTAs with both the EU and U.K., enabling Vietnamese firms to enjoy important preference margins over their Indian counterparts—in garments, for instance, the duty differential could be as high as 12 percent.\n\nHigh tariffs and other trade barriers also reduce domestic market competition and create incentives for protectionism to persist. Low tariffs can discipline rent-seeking behavior by large firms and are important in a context where industrial concentration is rising: The share of the largest five business groups in India’s nonfinancial sector rose from 10 percent in 1991 to nearly 18 percent in 2021. The discipline imposed by low tariffs was missing in India, where tariffs rose between 2015 and 2022.\n\nTrump announced a 26 percent tariff rate on India as part of his April 2 announcements, even as the two sides are pursuing an early closure to a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) by later this year. India is hoping, especially with the 90-day pause, that a concluded BTA will help it sidestep the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States.\n\nYet the most important and positive long-term fallout may be more consequential than any BTA that New Delhi and Washington sign. For India, rethinking its approach to trade is not about appeasing Trump—it is about fixing a system that undermines its export potential, weakens its position as a serious China+1 contender, limits its ability to secure comprehensive FTAs, and obstructs its broader economic ambitions.\n\nIn fact, there is growing recognition about the negative impact of India’s trade policies and its missed opportunities, prompting calls for a reexamination of its tariff and nontariff barriers. Perhaps Indian officials are also beginning to recognize this. On May 6, India and the U.K. concluded talks on an FTA that was in the works since 2022. It is the most ambitious deal that India has signed with any country so far.\n\nThe rest of the world has a deep stake in India’s economic potential. The United States remains the world’s biggest consumer, accounting for 13 percent of world demand for imported goods, although this share has declined from 18.9 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, since the start of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018, China’s share in world goods exports has only grown, from 12.7 percent in 2017 to 14.1 percent in 2023.\n\nIndia, with its size, youthful population, and large human resource base, has been called an obvious “plus one” in the China+1 space. India has undoubted potential to increase its low share of 1.8 percent (worth $432 billion) in world goods exports and 2.8 percent ($672 billion) in world goods imports. For example, its goods trade share of GDP was only 31 percent in 2023, compared with China’s trade peak of 64 percent of GDP in 2006, suggesting much room for trade to grow. A forthcoming paper by my colleagues T.G. Srinivasan, Baran Pradhan, and me at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress shows that in 2022, India’s goods exports could have been higher by $440 billion-$516 billion and goods imports higher by $244 billion-$301 billion. Adding these numbers to actual figures for 2022 would bring India’s goods trade close to $1 trillion each in exports and imports.\n\nDespite the possibly temporary U.S.-China trade truce, the world economy has already witnessed significant damage, with more to come. Countries are looking for bilateral deals with partners that commit to the spirit of open and predictable trade policies—and this involves a search for more reliable sources of supply as well as demand. On both counts, India can rise to the occasion, provided it abandons its protectionist instincts.",

        "content": "International trade is going through a much-needed reset. Several major countries, most notably the United States with its dramatic announcement last week, are shifting their approaches to trade, often in more protectionist directions. But it would be a mistake to view the events of recent months in isolation. To get the full picture, it’s necessary to start much earlier and examine the larger, and in some ways more profound, changes in global trade that have led up to this moment. At the same time, while a reset in trade is necessary today, a successful reset is unlikely to be achieved by focusing only on market access or exports of manufactured goods.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank published a report on how trade deals have moved away from older-style preferential trade agreements to so-called “deep trade” agreements, which go far beyond tariff barriers or market access. These “deep trade” agreements, as former Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Pascal Lamy explained, are “about regulatory measures and other so-called non-tariff measures that were once the exclusive domain of domestic policy making.” These agreements “cover policy areas such as competition, subsidies, and regulatory standards,” and they go beyond conventional border measures to “regulate the behaviour of the exporting and importing government.”\n\nFast forward to today, and the global trade scene is very different from just five years ago. As the World Bank’s website summarizes the shift: “Powerful protectionist forces have begun to challenge the global community’s commitment to open trade; many advanced economies blame trade for job losses as manufacturing and some services shift to lower-cost destinations.”\n\nToday, the United States, once an international advocate for open trade and competitiveness, is turning toward a more protectionist model of trade, announcing tariff and nontariff barriers and limiting market access—trade policies more commonly associated developing economies. It’s too early to predict how this will unfold, but some aspects of this global phenomenon have already come into focus.\n\nThe reasons for the change\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the volume of global exports and the number of international trade agreements rapidly increased. In much of the period since then, trade negotiations were managed between policymakers and seasoned bureaucrats, all working toward ensuring ease for the domestic consumer. Much of this work was done away from substantial public attention. Trade negotiations today, however, are too often loud political undertakings, used as either a coercion mechanism or a friendly gesture. The past few US administrations, several Latin American governments, and several Southeast Asian governments have tried to negotiate trade deals that are “worker-centered” and have attempted to advance trends such as “friend-shoring” or near-shoring, as many corporations planned to diversify their supply chains away from China.\n\nWhile the specter of China influenced this pivot, there was also an emphasis on modernizing manufacturing with more sophisticated technology. What was overlooked in this process, though, is the legitimate reason why advanced economies lost their competitive advantage in manufacturing to emerging economies. As economist Jagdish N. Bhagwati explained in 1982,\n\nthe pressure of import competition . . . can be seen as being addressed to industries undergoing a basic shift in comparative advantage, not because of technological advances arising in different parts of the world which are not being shared by competing nations, but rather because of shifts in labour costs or because “learning by doing” by latecomers is altering the traditional competitive edge of industries in the West.\n\nLabor-intensive industries are increasingly demonstrating comparative advantage in emerging economies, as they are compatible with capital intensity.\n\nAs capital-intensive industries are at a comparative advantage with emerging economies, technological advancements leading to digital trade are creating an advantage for Western economies. Digital commerce allows firms of all sizes, anywhere in the world, to gain access to new markets. But many emerging economies, although catching up fast, still lack the basics required for digital trade or even trade in services. These barriers can vary from inadequate infrastructure and regulatory uncertainty to data localization rules that restrict cross-border data flows.\n\nDigital trade plays a larger role than ever in the global economy. With an 8.1 percent average annual growth rate for almost two decades, it has outpaced other categories, such as goods trade. Yet this does not benefit all economies equally. International cooperation is crucial to promoting common and universal laws on digital trade as a precondition for it to grow and deliver more broadly shared benefits. But that will require building consensus on such rules.\n\nA pivot away from the WTO\n\nTraditionally, the role of consensus building has been played by multilateral organizations such as the WTO. But for the past three decades, the WTO has experienced a slow and steady decline in its influence as it has consistently faltered at its primary role of maintaining a rule-based trading system, ensuring predictability, and encouraging its member countries to make tariff adjustments in line with their economic development. One of the reasons for its decline is that the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism has not been functioning up to its potential due to the blocking—mainly by the United States—of appointments to its appellate body, leading to a paralysis of the appeals process and leaving trade disputes unresolved. In addition, many of the member countries refuse to let go of their self-declared “developing economies” status and continue to claim subsidies, which has further sowed discontent among developed economies.\n\nDespite these issues, no member has exited the WTO since its inception in 1995. Since the WTO assures market access and reprimands discriminatory trade practices, it would be unwise for any member to exit. One of the WTO’s recent successes came when it waived off certain patent restrictions to ensure the accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGiven the movement of labor-intensive jobs to developing economies, advanced Western economies’ domination of digital trade, and the disarmament of the WTO, most economies have started pivoting toward protectionist trade practices that are designed to restrict imports and promote domestic industries instead. Each nation is now pursuing its own political agenda, mistakenly believing that protectionist actions will bring economic benefits. Some are implementing soft protectionism, such as subsidies for favored industries. Others are implementing all-out protectionist policies. Meanwhile, rhetoric about geopolitical threats—often China—is used to garner support for preferential trade deals.\n\nThe rise of preferential trade agreements\n\nAs a result of the forces outlined above, preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are becoming the norm globally as an alternative arrangement to keep trade predictable and for economies to defend themselves against lawlessness. This is encouraging regionalism and fragmented trading practices, which often leads to fierce disagreements. As Bhagwati argued in 2008, “With PTAs proliferating, the trading system can then be expected to become chaotic.” A situation ensues in which there are “[c]risscrossing PTAs, where a nation had multiple PTAs with other nations, each of which then had its own PTAs with yet other nations . . . Indeed, if one only mapped the phenomenon, it would remind one of a child scrawling a number of chaotic lines on a sketch pad.”\n\nThe last decade has seen some significant preferential trade agreements ratified or at least signed. Significant among them are the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the African Continental Free Trade Area, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Countries in such regional preferential trade agreements account for about 78 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.\n\nHowever, what is concerning is that the three most important traders—China, the United States, and the European Union—have been unable to negotiate any trade agreements among themselves. Each of the three economies sees the others as sources of significant competition instead of comparative advantage. Regional trade agreements naturally exclude the economies that are not part of the bloc.\n\nYet, the interdependence on other markets is evident from 2021 trading data, which shows that 70 percent of North America’s exports, 41 percent of Asia’s, and 31 percent of Europe’s went outside their respective regions, while Africa and Latin America depend on other regions for 85 percent of their exports. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic starkly revealed how interconnected—and therefore vulnerable—global trade is. Supply chain shocks during the pandemic encouraged many countries and companies to hedge their risks.\n\nWhere global trade goes from here\n\nThis global trade reset cannot be achieved by focusing only on market access or exports of manufactured goods. Nor can it be achieved by signing regional trade agreements. Instead, the next chapter of global trade should rely on a new set of priorities that enhance a collective sense of security.\n\nWhat would this look like? This new era should include trade policies that advance economic interests as well as geopolitical interests. Governments should pursue climate and energy security, a digital economy that has universally agreed artificial intelligence regulations, and supply chains that are not dependent on one source alone. Resets are never easy in the short term, but they are an unavoidable phenomenon. In the best-case scenario, today’s global trade turmoil may lead to tomorrow’s renaissance.\n\nRidhika Batra is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: A worker walks past a container ship at Mundra Port in the western Indian state of Gujarat April 1, 2014.

Over the past three decades, the United States blocked appointments to the WTO appellate body, leading to paralysis of its appeals process and unresolved trade disputes. The WTO recently waived certain patent restrictions to ensure the accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain shocks encouraged many countries and companies to hedge their risks. In the last decade, significant preferential trade agreements (PTAs) were ratified or signed, including the USMCA, CPTPP, AfCFTA, and RCEP. Past US, Latin American, and Southeast Asian governments attempted to negotiate \"worker-centered\" trade deals and advance \"friend-shoring\" or \"near-shoring.\" Currently, the United States and several other major countries are shifting their trade approaches toward protectionism, announcing tariff and nontariff barriers and limiting market access. Most economies have started pivoting toward protectionist trade practices to restrict imports and promote domestic industries. China, the United States, and the European Union have been unable to negotiate trade agreements among themselves."

        "content": "While Donald Trump has modeled his policies on those imposed by the former US president William McKinley (1843-1901), whom he lauds as the \"king of tariffs\" for imposing 50% tariffs, he has ignored the fact that today's global economy is completely different from that at the end of the 19thcentury. At that time, trade accounted for 10% of the global GDP as opposed to 25% today. Supply chains now span the entire planet and no longer revolve around the Rust Belt in the northeastern United States as they did a century ago.\n\nTrump's tariff protectionism is therefore an unprecedented shock; the consequences of which are difficult to gauge, particularly as reciprocal tariffs considered by the US president will put an end to a system built at the end of the Second World War that, precisely to avoid geopolitical tensions, was based on non-discrimination with all countries being tariffed equally.\n\nWhat will tomorrow's global trade landscape look like? On February 18, Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, cited two dangers: \"Higher US tariffs on Chinese products will redirect Chinese overcapacity towards Europe, further hitting European firms,\" he said. Indeed, larger EU companies are more concerned about this effect than the loss of access to the US market.\"\n\nChina's exports are growing at three times the rate of world trade and propelling its trade surplus to record heights. It has overtaken its GDP threshold of 10% in 2024 and is approaching the record figure of 12% which it had reached before the 2008 financial crisis. It is a tsunami that has already damaged German industry, which is losing its market share in the automotive, cleantech and civil aviation sectors and according to a study by the think-tank Centre for European Reform, published in mid-January, \"China's macroeconomic imbalances now directly infringe on German industrial interests.\"\n\n## Investment announcements\n\nAnd the trend is likely to speed up.

        "content": "President Donald Trump's tariff policies have significantly harmed the United States economy, burdening American consumers, businesses and workers while dramatically failing to achieve their intended goals.\n\nDespite Trump's bold assertions that tariffs would rejuvenate American industry and restore fairness in global trade, economic research unequivocally demonstrates that these policies have backfired, imposing significant and lasting economic damage on the nation.\n\nAt their core, tariffs function as direct taxes on American consumers, raising the cost of imported goods and ultimately hitting the wallets of working and middle-class families hardest. Trump's first round of tariffs in 2019 led to an annual cost increase of approximately $831 per household , according to economists at the New York Federal Reserve. This price surge disproportionately impacts lower-income families, undermining their financial security and increasing economic inequality.\n\nIn 2025, Trump escalated his tariff strategy dramatically by declaring trade deficits a national emergency. He imposed an unprecedented 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imported goods, accompanied by significantly higher tariffs on key trade partners such as China, Mexico and the European Union. Rather than stabilizing the economy by creating jobs, this escalation immediately spiked consumer prices for everyday goods and essentials — whether it be food prices or clothing and textiles — exacerbating inflationary pressures and placing even greater financial stress on American households.\n\nThe damage extends far beyond rising consumer costs. Trump's aggressive tariff policies have provoked retaliatory actions from other nations, severely harming U.S. exporters, particularly in the agricultural sector. Retaliatory tariffs from China resulted in annual losses exceeding $10 billion for American farmers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Soybean exports, once a cornerstone of U.S. agriculture, plummeted, forcing many farmers to rely heavily on government subsidies rather than market-driven revenues.\n\nAdditionally, industries beyond agriculture, such as technology and automotive sectors, faced severe disruptions due to retaliatory tariffs and increased input costs. Companies have been forced either to absorb higher costs, thus reducing profitability and investment potential, or pass these costs on to consumers, further driving inflation.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, heavily championed by Trump as a beneficiary of his tariffs, has also suffered substantial setbacks. A comprehensive 2020 Federal Reserve study confirmed that manufacturing employment actually declined in industries dependent on imported components due to rising production costs, decreased global competitiveness and weakened demand.\n\nMoreover, Trump's unpredictable tariff approach has injected damaging uncertainty into the U.S. economy. This unpredictability deters business investment and slows economic growth. Harvard Business Review highlights how companies have delayed or canceled investment plans in response to unpredictable trade policy shifts, hindering innovation and job creation. Perhaps most striking is Trump's complete failure to address the very trade deficits his tariffs sought to reduce. A report by The Commerce Department revealed that the U.S. trade deficit not only persisted but widened during Trump's administration. Far from strengthening America's economic position, Trump's protectionist stance has isolated the U.S. internationally, eroding trust and damaging relationships with vital trading partners, such as Mexico, China and the European Union.\n\nBy pursuing a confrontational stance rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, Trump’s tariffs have diminished America’s ability to influence global economic standards positively. Our allies abroad have increasingly begun to view the U.S. as an unreliable partner, weakening America's strategic economic position globally.\n\nUltimately, Trump's tariffs represent an economically indefensible policy driven more by political symbolism than genuine economic rationale. They punish American families, damage key industries and fail to achieve even the basic objectives of job creation and trade deficit reduction. The economic costs far outweigh any perceived benefits.\n\nMoving forward, policymakers must decisively reject Trump's protectionist approach. Returning to evidence-based international trade practices is crucial for America's economic recovery and long-term prosperity. By abandoning harmful tariffs, the U.S. can restore consumer purchasing power, stimulate business investment and reestablish itself as a reliable and respected trade partner.\n\nOwen Puckett is an Opinion Editor and a member of the Editorial Board.

        "content": "Our Strategy Consulting teams help CEOs achieve maximum value for stakeholders by designing strategies that improve profitability and long-term value.\n\nWhat other tariffs were announced?\n\nThe administration confirmed it is imposing automotive tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act (for which the original investigation concluded in February 2019), starting on April 3, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe 25% tariff affects imported passenger vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans and cargo vans, and light trucks. Key automobile parts such as engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components also fall under the tariff.\n\nThe US imported a total of US$247b of motor vehicles in 2024 plus US$143b of automotive parts. Assuming 90% of Canadian auto imports would eventually become USMCA-compliant and 95% of Mexican auto imports would become USMCA-compliant, that would represent a total of nearly US$300b of imports subject to the tariffs.\n\nAssuming the tariffs are permanent, we estimate their impact to be a loss of 0.3% of GDP relative to a baseline in 2025, and a loss of 0.4% of GDP relative to a baseline in 2026. The impact on Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation would +0.2% in 2025. For the EU, Canada and Mexico, the GDP loss relative to the baseline would be 0.1% in 2025 and 0.4% in 2026. For Japan, it would be 0.1% in 2025 and 0.3% in 2026. For mainland China, it would be 0.1% and 0.2% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nWhat would the impact be of ending the ‘de minimis’ exemption for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong?\n\n\n\nPresident Trump is ending duty-free de minimis treatment for covered goods from mainland China and Hong Kong. Starting May 2, these goods will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or US$25 per item (increasing to US$50 per item after June 1, 2025).\n\nThe de minimis tariff exemption allows shipments bound for US businesses and consumers valued under US$800 (per person, per day) to enter the US free of duty and taxes. In 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimated a total of over 1 billion such shipments worth around US$54b entered the US if shipped through the international postal network. Covered goods shipped from mainland China and Hong Kong are subject to the reciprocal duties and all other applicable duties.\n\nWhile the total value of these shipments is modest compared to total US imports of over US$3t, research suggests that the elimination of the de minimis exemption would lead to a reduction in aggregate welfare around US$12b, disproportionately hurting lower-income consumers. Since roughly US$18b of de minimis shipments come from mainland China, mostly via e-commerce platforms, we estimate the loss of welfare from eliminating the mainland China exemption to represent around US$4b.\n\nWhat will the impact be on our baseline forecast and what are the recession odds?\n\nAs described above, our initial assessment of the economic impact of the new tariff measures points to a substantial hit to the US and global economy, with consumer spending possibly retrenching and a risk that the economy could fall into a recession.\n\nOn the growth front, the US economy could enter a recession in the second half of the year with a real GDP growth drag averaging 0.8ppt in 2025, bringing our average growth forecast from 1.5% down to 0.7%. By Q4 2025, real GDP could be contracting 0.5% y/y.\n\nOn the inflation front, the new reciprocal tariffs could raise US consumer price inflation by 0.8ppt by Q4 2025, with the inflationary impulse concentrated in the second quarter of the year.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the new tariffs and potential retaliation measures from targeted economies, we will adjust our baseline in the coming week to account for the latest developments. One thing is for sure though, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has risen from 40% just two weeks ago to around 60% today.\n\nHow will the Fed react?\n\n\n\nFed policymakers will maintain a reactionary stance in the coming month and will want to avoid front-running the impact of tariffs on output and inflation. We will likely see a growing fracture between those that are more concerned about the negative impact of tariffs on growth and employment and those more concerned about the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and persistently higher inflation.\n\nHow much certainty do we have about the permanence and breadth of these tariffs?\n\n\n\nThere will be latent uncertainty in the coming months surrounding the breadth of the tariffs and their duration. In terms of breadth, the administration has already started discussing the possibility of exemptions and exclusions at the country and sector levels. We will be producing a follow-up note with product-level analysis using the EY UPGRADE CGE model.\n\nSimilarly, we shouldn’t discount the possibility of some tariffs being imposed for a short period and then removed or reduced. Many economies have already begun to seek negotiations with the Trump administration to lower the tariffs.\n\nOn the flip side, it remains to be seen how the US administration will address certain products like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, energy and critical minerals that were excluded from the recent tariff announcements but have been identified by President Trump as targets for future sectoral tariffs.\n\nWhat is the risk for US consumers and businesses?\n\n\n\nBeyond immediate cost pressures, higher tariffs will undermine corporate and household sentiment on the economy while diverting production resources to resilience building. With consumers and businesses increasingly worried about the economic outlook, a wait-and-see approach is likely to be favored, and both groups could scale back future spending and investment intentions. This is particularly true as trade uncertainty has fed market volatility, with the US equity market underperforming. The ensuing negative wealth effect is likely to further constrain business investment and consumer spending.\n\nTo offset both the challenges around trade uncertainty and the higher cost of doing trade, businesses will adjust their strategies. Some will diversify supply chains, shifting sourcing to economies less impacted by the tariffs, while others may invest in automation and cost take-out exercises to cut costs and reduce dependence on imports.\n\nBeyond the short-term risks, what would the long-term (5- to 10-year) impact of reciprocal tariffs be?\n\nWe anticipate that the US economy will be among the economies most adversely affected by reciprocal tariffs, with the long-term impact on real GDP expected to be negative 0.7% — worth around US$200b annually.",

        "summary": "The administration confirmed imposing a 25% automotive tariff under Section 232 on imported passenger vehicles and key automobile parts, effective April 3. President Trump is ending duty-free de minimis treatment for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, subjecting them to a duty rate of 30% or $25 per item (rising to $50 after June 1, 2025). Many economies began seeking negotiations with the Trump administration to lower tariffs. The administration started discussing the possibility of country and sector-level tariff exemptions and exclusions. President Trump identified pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, energy, and critical minerals as targets for future sectoral tariffs. Fed policymakers will maintain a reactionary stance, avoiding front-running the tariff impact on output and inflation."
