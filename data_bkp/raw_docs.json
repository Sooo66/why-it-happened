        "content": "Intelligence and Counterterrorism Cooperation\n\nCore intelligence exchanges remain the preserve of individual nation states in Europe. They are outside of the EU and therefore also outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Thus these exchanges should not be affected by Brexit. The UK government is proud of what Theresa May has referred to as its “unique intelligence capabilities.” These stem from its traditional, close partnership with the U.S. and its membership in the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance of Anglosphere nations. No other European countries, including France and Germany, have the capability and reach of the UK, especially in the field of digital intelligence.28\n\nBritain also has a prime role in counter terrorism policy in Europe. The UK drafted the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy in 2005, which is modeled on the British national strategy. At the legislative level, the UK has strongly influenced some important EU initiatives such as the Europol Counter Terrorism Centre (CTC) and the PNRD.29 The UK has also taken the lead with its intelligence-led counter terrorism policing concept. This integrates the intelligence agencies with the police in order to start investigations into terrorist plots as early as possible in the attack cycle.30 The intelligence and police functions are normally kept separate in continental Europe, which can limit the timely exchange of vital information and slow down the investigation process. However, the UK has definitely benefitted from EU counter terrorism activities and agencies. The EAW, for instance, has greatly increased the speed of extraditions between EU states. Cases that previously took months or years are now resolved in weeks. Europol is valuable for police liaison and cooperation and Eurojust plays the same role for judicial cooperation. Britain has also joined the Schengen Information System, which allows police to share information on suspects and provides a network for sharing DNA, fingerprints, and vehicle registration documentation.31\n\nThere is no evidence that the referendum decision has had a negative impact on the UK’s counter-terrorism activities, at least so far. It is assumed that EU states will wish to continue close counter terrorism cooperation with the UK after Brexit, while Britain will also want to retain access to EU law enforcement databases and data-sharing platforms. The UK will presumably remain a member of the Counter Terrorist Group (CTG). CTG is a non-EU body where the heads of intelligence agencies of EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland meet to encourage members to share intelligence and facilitate operational cooperation. But this informal group is not yet a substitute for direct cooperation through the EU agencies identified above.\n\nAfter Brexit, the UK will have to negotiate new arrangements for all of these, possibly through a series of bilateral sharing agreements with individual states. Australia and the U.S., for example, have association agreements that allow them to have liaison officers at Europol. Nevertheless, officials acknowledge that there will be some practical limits on what can be achieved in comparison to the pre-Brexit situation. At the moment, there is no precedent for a non-EU country to plug directly into the Europol information system and the legislative framework for the EAW exists under ECJ jurisdiction that the UK will leave.32 The negotiation process, even if conducted with a mind to mutual security benefits, will at the very least hinder Britain and Europe’s efforts to create more powerful and mutually beneficial networks to fight terrorism. Sir Julian King, the EU Commissioner for Security Union, put the issue succinctly: “Because everybody agrees that you should do something does not mean that it is necessarily straightforward and easy to do…”33\n\nBritish government negotiators will be focused on trying to retain all the benefits of close counter terrorism cooperation with continental Europe. Meanwhile the government may face a renewed terrorism threat on another flank as the Brexit decision could exacerbate tensions in Northern Ireland. The UK government assesses the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland as “severe” and low level attacks by republican fringe groups have continued unabated despite the peace agreement signed in 2007. Up to 80% of the republican Sinn Fein supporters and other nationalists are believed to have voted for Remain.34 The potential renegotiation of the Common Travel Area Agreement, which could affect the current open border with the Republic of Ireland, and the loss of EU funding for Northern Ireland infrastructure projects, may increase nationalist sentiment. These developments may encourage violent republican dissidents to step up their campaign if they can build the necessary grassroots support. This was evidently lacking when such groups tried to exploit the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, but the complexities and uncertainties associated with Brexit in Northern Ireland may yet provide the support for renewed violence that has hitherto been absent.",

SOUNDBITE (English) David Cameron, British Prime Minister: “Good morning everyone. The country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise, perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people, from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar, have all had their say. We should be proud of the fact that in these islands, we trust the people with these big decisions. We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves and that is what we have done. The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected. I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believe was the national interest and let me congratulate all those who took part in the Leave campaign for the spirited and passionate case that they made. The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision.” ++FRAMES OF BLACK++ 3. SOUNDBITE (English) David Cameron, British Prime Minister: “I fought his campaign in the only way I know how: which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel, head, heart and soul. I held nothing back, I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union. And I made clear the Referendum was about this and this alone - not the future of any single politician including myself. But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination. This is not a decision I’ve taken lightly but I do believe it’s in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required. There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October. Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months. The Cabinet will meet on Monday, the Governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets.” 4. Cameron at lectern AND RESTRICTION SUMMARY: AP CLIENTS ONLY UK POOL - AP CLIENTS ONLY London - 24 June 2016 1. SOUNDBITE (English) David Cameron, British Prime Minister: “A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister. And I think it’s right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU. I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken, and my own decision.” ++FRAMES OF BLACK++ 2. SOUNDBITE (English) David Cameron, British Prime Minister: “Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way. Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way. And I will do everything I can to help. I love this country and I feel honoured to have served it. And I will do everything I can in the future to help this great country succeed. Thank you very much.” 3. Various of Cameron walking back to Number 10 with his wife Samantha",

But Northern Ireland and Scotland voted in favor of remaining, raising the specter that the United Kingdom itself may break apart.\n\nCameron announced he will resign before his Conservative Party conference in October.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union,\" Cameron said Friday. \"But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\"\n\nThe process of leaving the EU will likely take many years of negotiations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Dunham/AP Matt Dunham/AP\n\nIn the meantime, it's a period of \"tremendous uncertainty\" for the U.K. and Europe, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from London. And the fiery rhetoric that marked the debate over the referendum hasn't ended now that the results are in.\n\n\"The EU's failing, the EU's dying,\" said Leave campaigner Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, after the official results were announced. Farage said he anticipates the Netherlands and Denmark will follow Great Britain out of the European Union.\n\nThe value of the British pound plunged; at one point Friday it was lower against the U.S. dollar than it has been at any point since 1985.\n\nGlobal stock markets also plummeted as the vote counts trickled in Thursday night and Friday morning. NPR's John Ydstie notes, however, that markets had been up based on the erroneous belief that the U.K. would opt for \"remain\" — so the sharp decline actually returns markets to approximately where they were a week ago. Gold, meanwhile, went up.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn U.K., Elation, Surprise And Uncertainty\n\nOpinion polls showed a tight race, with the final poll — as well as the betting markets and the financial world — anticipating the U.K. would vote \"Remain.\" That meant for many in the U.K. and around the world, the referendum's outcome came as a shock.\n\nThe results showed sharp regional divisions in the United Kingdom. London, Scotland and Northern Ireland had strong pro-EU results, while rural and economically depressed areas backed the so-called Brexit in large numbers.\n\ntoggle caption Rob Stothard/Getty Images\n\nNPR's Frank Langfitt says that in London today, people who wanted to remain in the EU are both disappointed and \"very surprised.\"\n\n\"People who wanted out are elated,\" he said. \"There's one woman I talked to who actually screamed.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said voters were reacting to decades of mistreatment by successive governments.\n\n\"Many communities are fed up with cuts, fed up with economic dislocation and feel very angry at the way they've been betrayed and marginalized,\" Corbyn said.\n\nAnger over immigration was a potent force among the \"Leave\" camp, Frank says.\n\nMany voters who opted out of the EU \"felt that the price of immigration was just too high, that it was driving down wages, costing people jobs,\" he says. \"With some white Britons, there was a feeling also that the immigration was changing the nature of communities here.\"\n\ntoggle caption Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany voters also distrusted the experts and powerful leaders urging voters against the Brexit, Frank says:\n\n\"The rest of the world, for what it's worth, was telling the Brits not to do this. Economists almost uniformly were against this; they said it would damage the British economy and the global economy. Political leaders from Xi Jinping in China to Barack Obama said this would make Britain less relevant. But the voters — to some degree, I think, tired of being told what to do by the elites — made up their minds.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs U.K. Breaks Off, Might It Break Apart?\n\nNorthern Ireland's strong Remain vote led Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney to call for a referendum on unification with Ireland, an EU member country. Sinn Fein is the largest Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland's deputy first minister, nationalist Martin McGuinness, said holding such a vote is \"a democratic imperative.\"\n\nPro-British First Minister Arlene Foster, meanwhile, said there was \"no way\" such a vote would result in a united Ireland.\n\nScotland, too, may be eyeing a split with the U.K. — again. A 2014 referendum on Scottish independence resulted in the country remaining within the United Kingdom.\n\nBut now that the U.K. will be leaving the EU, a second referendum may be in the works. Scotland's voters preferred \"Remain\" over \"Leave,\" by 62 percent to 38 percent.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the result is Scotland being pulled out of Europe against its will.\n\n\"I regard that as being democratically unacceptable,\" she said Friday. \"It's a statement of the obvious that a second referendum [on independence] is on the table.\"\n\nIn Europe, 'Complete Shock'\n\nThe United Kingdom is (or was, until the pound crashed) the second-largest economy in the EU, and the referendum comes as a blow to the continent.\n\n\"I think there was complete shock this morning when people woke up,\" says NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, reporting from Berlin. \"Like most Europeans, everybody here thought they would wake up to the U.K. still being in the EU.\n\n\"It's unusual here to have a quick reaction from officialdom, but there actually was some reaction,\" she says. \"The vice chancellor I think summed it up for all when he tweeted, 'Damn, a bad day for Europe.' \"\n\nCurrent EU president Donald Tusk said the group is \"determined to keep our unity at 27,\" referring to the number of member nations minus Great Britain. He went on to say, quoting his father, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\"\n\nThe EU assembly will hold an emergency session next week in the wake of the news, The Associated Press reports. The referendum's results will also be the top item on the agenda for an upcoming summit of EU leaders in Brussels.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGermany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, tweeted the vote was \"a sad day for Europe and Britain.\" France's foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said he was \"sad for the United Kingdom.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPoland's foreign ministry, meanwhile, called it a \"warning signal\" of \"disillusionment with European integration,\" the AP reports. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, said the vote pivoted on the question of immigration and signaled the importance of Brussels listening to the \"voice of the people\" in member states. Anti-immigration sentiment has been playing a central role in politics within both countries.\n\nEuroskeptic parties in Sweden and Denmark called for EU membership referenda in their own nations, the AP writes, as did far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France.\n\nAs for what happens next: NPR's Peter Kenyon explains there is a two-year window for the U.K. and the EU to come to an agreement over the terms of its departure from Europe.\n\nAs Peter noted earlier, some members of the \"Remain\" camp have worried that a Brexit would give the EU an incentive to keep other member states from fleeing: \"Therefore, the argument goes, they would offer the U.K. very poor exit terms — such as drastically limiting the U.K.'s access to the EU single market — as a warning to other states.\"\n\ntoggle caption Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn U.S., Economic Effects And Political Echoes\n\nWhile laws and policies in the U.K. aren't changing immediately, the impact of the Brexit on the rest of the world, including the U.S., has already begun.\n\nThe British pound is one of the world's stable \"reserve\" currencies, and it's fallen precipitously in value. Markets, too, have contracted. On Friday morning, the Dow opened and immediately dropped approximately 500 points.\n\n\"I think over the long term for the United States, it's going to mean a little bit slower economy,\" reports NPR's John Ydstie. \"It means a stronger dollar, which is going to hurt exports. It also means that our trading partners, like the EU and the U.K., are going to go through a period of uncertainty and their growth could be hampered — so, again, exports to those countries could be hurt.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs NPR's Marilyn Geewax has previously reported, there's also the risk of a domino effect of exits — whether Scotland leaving the U.K. or more countries leaving the EU. Either would cause political instability, \"as well as disruptions in flows of labor, capital and commerce,\" Marilyn writes, \"harming U.S. business dealings.\"\n\n\"But some conservatives say Brexit would spur growth by freeing the U.K. from regulatory overreach by EU bureaucrats,\" Marilyn notes.\n\nAnd, John says, \"I guess the silver lining to this cloud is that if you're taking a trip to the U.K. this summer for a vacation, your dollar is going to go a little bit further.\"\n\ntoggle caption Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, many observers are noting the similarities between the politics over the referendum and the U.S. presidential election.\n\nTony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, spoke with NPR's Frank Langfitt after the referendum results were announced.\n\n\"I think the lesson is, in part, a traditional one: a disconnect between political elites as they're called — people who run the government and the financial system and so on — and most other people,\" Travers said. \"And, you know, in the United States the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, I think, is evidence of a similar phenomenon.\"\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is currently in the U.K. visiting the Trump Turnberry golf course.\n\nAlthough he was in Scotland — which, again, overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU — Trump tweeted that the \"place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back.\"\n\nSpeaking at his golf course in Scotland, he said people are angry, which fueled the Brexit vote. He also said the weaker pound will help business at the golf course.\n\nIn a statement, Trump said Americans, too, will have an opportunity to \"re-declare their independence\" and \"reject today's rule by the global elite,\" and said he hoped America is watching.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Obama issued a statement Friday morning, saying \"the people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision.\"\n\n\"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring,\" he said. \"So too is our relationship with the European Union.\"",

        "content": "The decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union – known as Brexit – shines a spotlight on the divisions in public opinion between the UK and the continental members of the EU, and within the UK on a range of issues relating to the future of Europe.\n\nThe June 23 referendum – in which the public voted 52% to 48% to leave – is a reminder that the British have never been as enamored with the EU as most of their continental counterparts. Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started. A majority of the Greeks (68%) and pluralities of the Dutch (44%), Germans (43%), Italians (39%) and French (39%) all want some EU power returned to their national governments. Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues, and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU.\n\nNOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.",

        "content": "On June 23, U.K. citizens will head to the polls to answer one question: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\"\n\nThe decision to leave would rattle an establishment that has been in operation for decades. The EU is an economic and political partnership between 28 member nations committed to the prosperity of the region as a whole. Britain joined the European Economic Community, which would later be absorbed into the EU, in 1973 and has been a valuable contributing member since.\n\nBut in recent years, anti-European rumblings have become more pronounced in the country.\n\nIn 2013, in response to public outcries and increasing pressure from members of Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on the U.K.'s membership in the European Union if his Conservative Party won the next election. The party won, and Cameron made good on his commitment when the June 23 date was set in February.\n\nCameron laid out a plan in late 2015 that attempted to change the terms of the U.K.'s membership in the EU without leaving the group. His efforts fell short in a deal that was finalized with EU leaders in early 2016, and \"Brexit\" – a splice of \"Britain\" and \"exit\" – was born. The nation has since divided itself into the \"remain\" camp – including Cameron and former Prime Minister Tony Blair – and the \"leave\" camp – including former London Mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nThe decision that faces U.K. citizens is a political, economic and emotional one, shrouded by uncertain outcomes and largely without precedence (the U.K. held a similar referendum vote in 1975, but 67 percent of citizens voted to stay). Here are a few charts that explain what is known about Brexit and the U.K.'s relationship with the EU.\n\nThe EU represents 508 million people from 28 member states. The nations cumulatively comprise about a fourth of the world's economic output, totaling $18.5 billion in 2014, and the U.K.'s gross domestic product accounts for about 15 percent of the EU's total product.\n\nEach member nation contributes a monthly sum to the EU's operating budget based on a tax formula in return for policies and programs that benefit the region. In pure budgetary terms, a number of countries that contribute most to the EU's operating budget stand to gain least from EU expenditures. In 2014, the U.K. gave nearly $5.5 billion more to the EU than it took from the budget, accounting for 8 percent of total national contributions, but less than 5 percent of the EU's total expenditures, according to the European Commission . Germany had an even greater negative balance – more than $17 billion after contributing 18 percent of the budget. Italy had a negative balance of $5 billion after contributing 10 percent of the budget.\n\nEU-funded initiatives in the U.K. highlighted by the European Commission include a $78 million investment in Superfast Cornwall, a commitment to connect at least 80 percent of homes and business in the rural county to \"fibre-optic superfast broadband,\" and an $8 million investment in the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine to fund the construction of new facilities for stem cell research.\n\nThe \"free movement of people is one of the EU's fundamental principles,\" according to the EU freedom of movement and residence directive passed in 2004. Nearly 3 million people from other EU countries have migrated to the U.K., according to the United Nations Population Division , and 1.2 million from the U.K. have moved elsewhere in the Union. And while the U.K. remains a member of the EU, these 4 million migrants have the \"right to move freely and live in another EU country,\" but there is no precedent as to what happens to those from a country or living in a country that removes itself from the EU.\n\nIn addition to people, goods, services and money are able to move freely within the EU's single market as if it were one country. Free trade within EU borders is supposed to mutually benefit all member nations and attract international partnerships to a large European trade bloc. U.S. President Barack Obama said that the U.K. would be at the \"back of the queue\" for a trade deal if it votes to leave the EU and that it could take a decade to negotiate a new agreement. The U.S. is currently the U.K.'s largest export destination.\n\nResults of the referendum have been tough to predict. Many polls consistently report a split of less than 5 percentage points. Generally, though, the majority of younger people and richer people say they will vote \"remain,\" while the majority of older people and poorer people say they will vote \"leave.\"\n\nThe views of other EU citizens are much clearer: they want the U.K. to remain part of the club. \"France is the only country where more than a quarter of the public says it would be positive for the EU if the UK departed,\" according to a Pew Research Center report from April. In an earlier survey of 28,000 European voters by Lord Michael Ashcroft, former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party who has become known for his political polls, only 10 percent said they would like the U.K. to leave the EU. Sixty percent of those surveyed said they would prefer the U.K. stay in the EU, and 30 percent said it didn't matter. At 24 percent, Luxembourg had the highest portion of people who said they would prefer the U.K. to leave the EU, and Lithuania had the highest portion of people that would prefer the U.K. to stay.\n\nBritish and Irish citizens who live in the U.K. and are older than 18 can vote on the referendum, as long as they registered to vote before the June 9 deadline. A record number of 525,000 applications on June 6 caused the government registration website to crash and spurred an extension of the initial June 7 deadline. More than 1 million people registered to vote in the last days before the deadline.\n\nAlso eligible to vote are British and Irish citizens living abroad who have been registered to vote for at least 15 years and Commonwealth citizens living in the U.K.\n\nIf U.K. citizens vote \"leave,\" transitioning out of the EU could effectively take years. But pressure on the voters is much more immediate; they'll have to make up their minds before heading to the polls this week.",

        "content": "The United Kingdom would lose more than gain if it left the European Union, a Stanford scholar said.\n\nWhether the United Kingdom should remain part of the European Union will be determined in a British referendum on June 23. Stanford lecturer Christophe Crombez recommends the UK remain in the EU. (Image credit: gOd4ather / Shutterstock)\n\nSo would other European nations, and the real winners would be countries that seek to divide European unity, said Christophe Crombez, a consulting professor in Stanford’s Europe Center in the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\n\nBritain is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether the country should leave or remain in the European Union.\n\n“It would bring but an illusion of sovereignty,” said Crombez, who studies European Union politics, parliamentary systems, political economy and economic analysis of political institutions. He is an economist from Belgium.\n\nThe Stanford News Service recently interviewed Crombez on the upcoming vote, known as “Brexit.”\n\nWhat is Brexit?\n\nThe term Brexit refers to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union allows member states to withdraw.\n\nWhat are the arguments for and against Brexit?\n\nThe campaign for the UK to leave the EU uses the following main arguments: leaving would save UK taxpayers money, since the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget; the UK would no longer have to comply with EU laws it does not want, whereas currently it can be outvoted in EU institutions and forced to adopt laws it opposes; and it would allow the UK to better control migration, whereas EU citizens are currently free to move and work throughout the EU.\n\nThese three arguments can easily be refuted, however. The UK does indeed contribute to the EU budget, but the benefits it derives from being part of the EU market far outweigh the budgetary contributions. Moreover, (if Britain were to withdraw) the EU would require the UK to pay into its budget, if it wants to remain part of the EU’s internal market, as it has done with Switzerland and Norway.\n\nAlso, about half of UK exports are destined for the EU. If the UK were to leave, it would no doubt want to continue to trade with the EU. UK products would have to conform to EU rules for them to be sold in the EU. UK companies that want to export to the EU would thus continue to comply with EU rules. The difference would be that the UK would no longer be involved in setting those EU rules. Post-Brexit, the rules would thus be less to the UK’s liking than prior to it, and UK companies would comply to these less advantageous rules.\n\nFinally, the EU would impose requirements on immigration and free movement of people on the UK in exchange for free trade with the EU, as it has with other countries in similar situations, such as Norway and Switzerland. Moreover, member states may no longer feel inclined to stop refugees from moving on to the UK if the UK were to leave, which may lead to higher rather than lower immigration.\n\nIn addition to these arguments, the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign (which supports the UK remaining in the EU) argues that Britain carries more weight in world politics as part of the EU than on its own, in trade negotiations as well as on security issues, and that a united Europe is better at dealing with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and other authoritarian rulers, terrorist threats and international crime.\n\nWhat do you think is the best decision for the United Kingdom to make on this vote?\n\nI see no advantages to leaving the EU. It would bring but an illusion of sovereignty – consider the points above. The vote would have a negative impact on growth in the UK and the rest of the EU and, in fact, the world, and it would weaken the UK, the EU and the West in world politics.\n\nWhat happens economically to Britain if the country leaves the European Union?\n\nTrade and hence gross domestic product would be negatively affected, especially in the short term. Uncertainty would reduce investment and trade. The UK and the EU would be consumed with the negotiations on the break-up for years. This would prevent both the UK and EU from tackling more important economic and security issues. In the long term, the economy would readjust, but the result would be suboptimal.\n\nWhat happens to the EU if Britain leaves?\n\nThe EU is less dependent on trade with the UK than vice versa. There would be an economic impact, but it would be less substantial. The effect would be more significant for a few countries that trade more with the UK, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nBrexit would, however, deliver a major blow to the idea of European unification. It would weaken the EU impact in world politics and strengthen such rulers as Putin and (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan in their dealings with the EU.\n\nCould a British exit open up a Pandora’s Box of other EU countries exiting or spark other regional independence movements, like Catalonia?\n\nThat is quite possible. A number of other countries may want to hold referendums on the EU. Moreover, Brexit is likely to lead to a break-up of the UK. Scotland would likely hold another referendum and decide to leave the UK in order to stay in the EU. The same may be true for Northern Ireland in the long run. Scottish secession may then give other EU regions, such as Catalonia, further incentives to secede.",

        "content": "Since British voters elected on Thursday to leave the European Union, signs have quickly emerged of the flaws in holding a referendum on such a messy, massive, far-reaching decision. Politicians responsible for explaining what's at stake have admitted they may have fudged some of the consequences. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, acknowledged Friday merely an hour after the election was called that one of the Leave campaign's key promises to voters was inaccurate. Brexit backers pledged that money the U.K. currently sends to the E.U. — supposedly £350 million ($462 million) a week — would go to the country's national health system instead. Former London mayor Boris Johnson even drove around Britain in a bus blaring that message.\n\nOn Friday, Farage called that claim a \"mistake.\" (Kudos to the incredulous TV reporter who then followed up: \"Do you think there are other things people will wake up this morning and find out aren't going to happen as a result of voting this way?\")\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritons react to cutting ties with the European Union + 53 In late June, many celebrated the referendum results, and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he will resign after Britons went to the polls.\n\nResidents of relatively poor Cornwall, meanwhile, had been promised they would lose none of the E.U. subsidies the county heavily relies on if Britain were to leave the bloc. Cornwall officials, The Washington Post's Rick Noack writes, are now fretting that wasn't true either.\n\nNot surprisingly, after the value of the British pound plummeted and global stocks tanked Friday, British media have also been full of stories of voters saying they regretted their decision. Some said they merely thought they were lodging a protest vote — they didn't think Brexit would actually happen. Others actually called election workers wondering if they could change their vote. This woman remarkably said every voting member of her family made a mistake:\n\nMeanwhile, more than three million Brits as of Sunday morning had already called for do-over. And critics have recounted scathingly that the whole crisis originated because Prime Minister David Cameron was trying to escape a political bind back in 2013 — hardly a grand rationale for a massive experiment in direct democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this was, perhaps, predictable, as some political scientists and historians have warned that a simple yes-or-no public referendum can be a terrible way to make a decision with such complex repercussions. The process looks like direct democracy in its purest form, and it was celebrated as such by many Leave campaigners after the vote. But David A. Bell, a Princeton historian writing in The New Republic four years ago as Greece was preparing for a referendum on its bailout, argues that the result of referendums is much more often anti-democratic.\n\nHe divides referendums into two categories: The first implicates fundamental questions of sovereignty (should Quebec become independent, or Scotland break away from Great Britain?). These kinds of referendums are appropriate, Bell argues: \"They represent instances when sovereign power, always ultimately held by the people, but mediated by constitutional structures, temporarily reverts to the people directly, so that they can modify or replace these structures.\"\n\nThen there are referendums about questions that would otherwise be handled by the legislatures the people have already elected:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is certainly tempting to salute this second form of referendum as a means of checking the seamy practices that too often infect modern representative systems. But however much the designers of referendums claim to be acting in the name of democratic reform, their actions usually end up undercutting democratic institutions. This tendency isn’t merely incidental — it’s unavoidable given how referendums work. First, they take relatively technical issues away from legislators who have the time and expertise to deal with them, and give them to voters who do not.\n\nReferendums also tend to make legislating in the future much harder, by casting policies as constitutional changes that are hard to dislodge. And, Bell argues, they undermine the legitimacy of legislatures by suggesting that real democracy can only come directly from the people instead.\n\nIn a world where all kinds of decisions that should be made by legislators are made by referendums instead, we get, well, California — a state where ballot initiatives rule what happens to individual bonds and bag taxes and even proposed buildings. Back in 1978, California voters generously decided in a ballot measure to cap their own property taxes in a way — amending the state constitution — that has hobbled ever since California's ability to generate revenue and create reasonable housing policy.\n\nLast year's Supreme Court decision upholding gay marriage also underscored another drawback of referendums: Give people a chance at the ballot box, and they may also trample minority rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo come back to Bell's distinction about the two different kinds of referendums, the Brexit vote arguably looks a little like both. Brexit supporters certainly cast the question as one of fundamental sovereignty and \"independence\" from Europe (as did Donald Trump, with his praise of voters who wanted to \"take back their country\"). But the proposition at hand also raised the kinds of thorny debates we elect government officials to hash out: Do the benefits of the E.U. justify those payments? Will the costs of leaving cripple the British economy? Will \"independence\" bring new forms of instability that voters haven't even been encouraged to foresee?\n\nMartin Kettle, an editor at the Guardian in the U.K., argued last Thursday, before the final vote, that Brexit should itself be a referendum on referendums, \"now the weapon of choice for populist parties of left and right\":\n\nThere may, in certain circumstances, be an argument for referendums in our politics. But the argument has to be better than that we have had some referendums in the past or that a lot of the public would like one. People will always agree they want a say. Yet it is far from obvious that a system of referendums strengthens trust in democracy. Neither Ireland nor Switzerland, where referendums are more common, seem to vindicate that. Germany’s constitution is strongly rooted in the opposite view. And if an issue is major enough to require a referendum, why is it not major enough to require a high level of turnout or an enhanced majority of those voting, as should be the norm?",

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has directly or indirectly involved in the loss of lives of more than 3.24 million as of 6th May, 2021. The increasing threats posed by this pandemic were subsided by the swift and drastic measures put in place by different countries. As other causes of death before the emergence of COVID-19 still exist, the pandemic has further worsened their impact. The increased risks of COVID-19 deaths are not only due to the health burden it possesses, but also due to some other factors. These factors include domestic violence that becomes rampant, especially during lockdowns; hunger due to low economic development, unemployment, and loss of jobs; suicide due to depression; exhausted health system due to high level of COVID-19 cases and inability to contain it. As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic’s direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery. This paper identifies other causes of death amidst the pandemic, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, and how to minimize their effects.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest respiratory disease outbreaks affecting several countries simultaneously and has affected over 200 countries as of April 2021 (David and Ozuluoha, 2020). As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic’s direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery (Bernard et al., 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has affected many homes and families. It has caused numerous deaths in the world with greater collateral damages in some low and middle-income countries where people do not have access to proper healthcare, food, and jobs (Lim et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These factors have, in turn, influenced other triggers of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The numerous deaths triggered by COVID-19 and other factors that made the pandemic out of control, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, are discussed extensively in this paper, and suitable solutions that could reduce these risks are proposed in detail.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Human Lives\n\nWhile different countries’ policies vary, a lockdown declaration seemed like a common occurrence across many countries (De Ver Dye et al., 2020). The declared lockdown, though having many advantages, came in with other notable disadvantages. Some of the considerable impacts are seen on the health of people with chronic diseases (Umaru et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2020a), treatment of malaria (Aborode et al., 2021a), education (Lawal et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2020b), drugs supply (Dada et al., 2020), healthcare services (David and Adebisi, 2020; Ahmad et al., 2021). The magnitude of these impacts has created an atmosphere where people are more susceptible to deaths not only directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic, but indirectly to other factors.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nCOVID-19 has radically changed the lives of many individuals. During the quarantine mandated by governments to curb the spread of COVID-19, domestic violence made some people’s homes a more dangerous place to live and survive. This could be because they must stay the whole day with partners and away from people who can witness their experiences and give help. Many abusive situations were on an increase due to economic crises linked to COVID-19 emergence (many victims have difficulty leaving abusive partners for financial reasons). In addition, lockdown triggered the increased risk of domestic violence where parents fight with one another, children unable to handle the mental stress of such acts, thus increasing the prevalence of suicide, mental instability, and physical deformation (Elbert et al., 2018; Cluver et al., 2020). A recent study has proven a rise in domestic violence and social decadences during pandemics (Brooks et al., 2020). The rise in domestic violence during pandemics increases the level of violence and social menace that cannot be control easily due to low engagement of people and lockdown. Domestic violence during pandemics is linked to the adoption of negative stress coping mechanisms that occur between spouses, parents, and individuals during pandemic lockdowns. Lockdown also brings abusers closer to their victims for an extended period, consequently increasing the probabilities of repeated occurrences (Brenner, 1987; Reynolds et al., 2008; Palermo and Peterman, 2011).\n\nSeveral media reports indicate a surge in domestic violence cases in various countries (Lima et al., 2020; van Gelder et al., 2020; Gearin and Knight, 2020). According to Kagi (2020), the overall crime rates in Australia have declined, however, the rate of domestic abuse increased by 5%. Some charities in Australia also raised concerns about COVID-19 misinformation used by the offenders to further control and abuse domestic violence victims (Kagi, 2020). Allen-Ebrahimian (2020) reported that China witnessed a threefold increase in domestic violence cases after imposing lockdown. Different states in the United States also reported about 21–35% increase in the number of domestic violence recorded (Wagers, 2020). According to Bradbury-Jones and Isham (2020), the lockdown imposed to deal with COVID-19 pandemic has granted greater freedom to abusers. It has become easier for the abusers to enforce control tactics by limiting the victims’ access to phones, the internet, and other people, while van Gelder et al. (2020) also emphasized that the lockdown limits familiar support options.\n\nThe proposed solutions to the occurrences of domestic violence are strengthening online support and aids systems (Haneef and Kalyanpur, 2020). There should be advocacy platforms aimed at curtailing the several factors catalyzing the spikes in violence against persons (WHO, 2020). Also, there should be proposed plans that will reduce the risk triggers of domestic violence, which results to death during COVID-19 pandemic. It is required that prioritizing violence prevention within the global public health agenda be encouraged. This can be done by defining the problem through the systematic collection of information, using research evidence to determine the causes and risk factors of violence, and implement effective interventions to prevent violence. Achieving these goals becomes particularly important during the pandemic because violence against women has dramatically increased (WHO, 2020). The effectiveness of online safety and health interventions for different needs of women who have experienced intimate partner violence have already been outlined previously (El-Serag and Thurston, 2020; Ford-Gilboe et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, to reduce the mortality rates due to domestic violence during COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for funding sources to enhance telephone or remote counseling services with high-speed internet, hotlines, and emergence shelters. It is also mandatory to identify high-risk individuals and admonish them to avoid extreme events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide.\n\nHunger\n\nAgriculture has remained the primary source of food globally, and hence agriculture plays a vital role in the nation’s economic development. The lockdowns imposed by countries have resulted in an obstruction to the free flow of all the stages involved in agriculture i.e. from farm to fork (including production, processing, distribution, and consumption). This has consequently resulted in a hike in the prices of food commodities (Torero, 2020). As a result of this increase in food prices and a further anticipated hike, food shortages, malnutrition, and even deaths have been recorded (Torero, 2020). The United Nations World Food Program has estimated that by the end of the year 2020, over 265 million people could suffer from food shortages and hunger (Food Security Information Network, 2020).\n\nIn a national survey conducted in the United States of America, it was shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has directly increased the rate of food insecurity in households having children (Bauer, 2020). This survey showed that 34.5% of households with a child ≤18 years old and 34.4% of families with children ≤12 years old were experiencing food shortages by the end of April 2020, compared with 14.7 and 15.1% in 2018, respectively (Bauer, 2020). It was also shown that 17.4% of mothers with children ≤12 years old reported that “the children in my household were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food,” compared to 3.1% in 2018 (Bauer, 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic aggravated the hunger crisis in the world’s hunger hotspots and created new epicenters of hunger worldwide. By the end of the year, 12,000 people per day died from COVID-19 pandemic, which is linked to hunger, potentially more than the disease (Siguerva et al., 2020). The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality, and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the socioeconomic disparities across borders and communities, there has been expansive togetherness, love, and care. The lockdown, however, introduced several economic hardships Siguerva et al. (2020); Aborode et al. (2021b), such as coronavirus famine, food insecurity and adverse hunger, which triggered risk of human death. Neglecting to combat hunger may have caused severe malnutrition and starvation, as evident in war-torn or ravaged ambient. These correlated to salient risk factors or determinants Chukwuma (2020) for compromised immune systems and facilitated susceptibility to infection rates, life-threatening disorders associated with the novel coronavirus. These disorders include severe respiratory distress, pneumonia, diarrhea, cholera, other gastrointestinal diseases Chaolin et al. (2020), and emerging and re-emerging diseases Chukwuma (2018) to poor sanitation and inadequate water supply.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of hunger during COVID-19 pandemic on human lives, there is a need for COVID-19 economic recovery palliative. This will provide families with prompt and adequate access to food and other resources during and after the pandemic crisis. There is also a need for an improvement in the nutritional intake of people who are vulnerable- mostly people with low standard of living and other factors that trigger their vulnerability such as health issues (El Zowalaty et al., 2020). Sustainable development policies, actions, and good governance will reduce and eventually eradicate the burden of poverty triggered by hunger (Chukwuma, 2020; Abdullahi et al., 2021). Sustainable steps need to be taken to prevent deaths secondary to hunger amidst the pandemic, as they can affect other sectors if not duly attended to because human survival depends on quality foods. In addition, there should be an assurance that food will be readily available to people who need them. This is to mitigate the consequences posed by hunger, which can result in death if there is no action implemented.\n\nSuicide\n\nThe potential of COVID-19 pandemic to cause long-lasting morbidity implies that it may serve as a risk factor for mental illness and suicide in the end. It was found that psychosis (a risk factor for suicide) was high in people during the H1N1, MERS, and SARS pandemics (Rogers et al., 2020). Wasserman (1992) stated that the Spanish flu epidemic (1918–1920) resulted in a slight increase in the number of suicide cases in the United States of America. In Hong Kong, the 2003 SARS epidemic also increased the rates of suicide cases (Cheung et al., 2008). Generally, few studies have investigated the impact of prior pandemics on suicide rates (Wasserman, 1992; Cheung et al., 2008).\n\nThe factors that result in suicide during COVID-19 are also due to the economic hardship faced by people, with loss of jobs occupying the premium position. Other factors that trigger suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic are entrapment, social isolation, alcohol consumption, and loneliness (O’Connor and Kirtley, 2018; David et al., 2020b).\n\nTo reduce the rate of suicide triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, there should be programs and awareness campaigns organized by NGOs and government bodies that will ensure proper mental health education for people. These programs would inform them on how to take care of their mental health and why they need to take care of their loved ones. The lockdowns imposed in several parts of the world have resulted in economic hardship and loss of jobs for many people, thus creating financial stressors (Cheung et al., 2008). These are among the risk factors for suicide. The government should provide financial security to ease the hardship posed by these circumstances. These can be in the form of housing, food, employment support, and consideration for their future and not just their current situations. There should be a responsible reporting of suicide cases so that people can maintain their emotional and mental stability; irresponsible reporting of spikes of suicide recorded instilled fear in people’s minds (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020). Finally, support in form of easy-accessible and well-distributed telephone help-lines should be available to help people with their mental health.\n\nDeaths Triggered by Exhausted Health System\n\nThe disruption of healthcare services to other medical conditions due to the drifted attention given to COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many deaths (Santoli et al., 2020). The deaths triggered by healthcare inability to provide services to all patients was because of the priorities given to COVID-19 patients and suspected patients at the expense of others (Lange et al., 2020). During the pandemic, regular healthcare services inevitably reduced because of concerns about SARS-CoV-2 exposure, restructuring regular hospital facilities to facilitate the COVID-19 patients, shifting of health professionals from their professional department to COVID-19 departments, shortage of beds, shortage of operation theaters, and shortage of doctors and nurses (Babatunde et al., 2020; Aborode et al., 2021c). This has also decreased in-person services, and supported the use telehealth in order to address some healthcare needs of patients (Lange et al., 2020).\n\nTo solve the problem of increased deaths from other causes due to healthcare system’s inability to provide services to all patients, balancing the direct response to COVID-19 with the need for other health services’ continuous delivery is a universal dilemma for policymakers (Aborode et al., 2021d). It is particularly challenging for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems already face enormous demands to address infectious and non-communicable diseases coupled with significant resource constraints (Oseran et al., 2020; Abdullahi et al., 2020). The leaders should evaluate different policy options that will effectively respond to COVID-19 by exacerbating all the causes of morbidity and mortality among the population from neglecting or diverting care for other conditions (Stuckler et al., 2009).\n\nFurthermore, exploring underlying reasons for medical care avoidance should be act on, which include people with disabilities, people with underlying health conditions, unpaid caregivers for adults, and those who face structural inequities. If care for population survival rate and standard of living were neglected because of concerns about SARS-CoV-2 exposure or if there were closures or limited options for in-person services, providing accessible telehealth or in-home health care could address some of these issues (Oseran et al., 2020).\n\nCommunities, health care systems, and public health agencies should foster equity by working together to ensure access to information, testing, and care to all. The higher prevalence of medical care delay or avoidance among patients with high medical service bills or payments on people with no money might reflect differences in medical care-seeking behaviors (Chan et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many unprecedented events and an increase in the number of non-COVID-19 deaths. To deal with the direct effects of the pandemic and prior to universally available vaccination, many governments have imposed lockdowns to reduce the viral spread. This, however, has resulted, in social distancing, economic instability, mental health problems, isolation, depression, domestic violence, suicide, hunger, and a strained healthcare system that was not able to provide services as usual (David et al., 2020a). Although there have been studies exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the causes of death triggered by other factors such as domestic violence, suicide, hunger, and exhausted healthcare system is of great importance. There is a need for NGOs, governments, and individuals to play a role in mitigating these challenges.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThere is no data available for this study as this is a perspective research study..\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nKD, IY, and AA conceptualized the topic.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe world is gripped by a truly global public health emergency. From New York to Wuhan, attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (officially, SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.[1] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed. As the pandemic[2] spreads, the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable, among them refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs). These populations must be included in the global response to the virus. This is essential to protecting not only these communities, but societies at large.\n\nThe scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world’s populations are. Nevertheless, at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential, many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens. But a virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.\n\n“A virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.”\n\nThe world’s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable. Already, their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways. The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live. A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe first factor is population density. Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions, including formal camps, informal settlements, or population-dense urban spaces. Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, the same cooking, and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all. Some are forced to share the same tent. In some countries, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention, often in appalling conditions. The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous.\n\nSecond, the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare. When they have access, it tends to be to primary healthcare. Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent, especially in camp settings. In addition, those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions, including malnutrition, psychosocial stress, and other infectious diseases like TB. These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThird, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging. Without critical information about the coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies. At risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick.\n\nFourth, the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak. Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis. Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies. Steps to close borders, halt transportation, and shutter businesses are interrupting supply. The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts.\n\nFinally, as governments, NGOs, and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic, the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically. Already, responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded. The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nCertainly, many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents. What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises. The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nAsia\n\nChina was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region, including to south Asia—home to some of the world’s largest populations of refugees and IDPs. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements. The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings.\n\nAfghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People\n\nAlmost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans. Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran, representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19, now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world.[3] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak.[4] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses.[5][6] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran, the situation is most dire. Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak. Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan. Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014, the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced.[7] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients.[8] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations, the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population’s humanitarian needs are massive. More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced. Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan,[9] a significant number had recently come from Iran.[10] They had entered through the city of Herat, where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness. Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s almost 39 million people might be infected.[11]\n\nRohingya Refugees\n\nHealth authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps. There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox’s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them. Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned, “the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages.”[12]\n\n“Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease.”\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies. Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention.[13] However, UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce, much less across the refugee population. The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps, undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness. Meanwhile, health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items.\n\nCommunicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal, credible communications networks. The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly. This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus. The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information.[14]\n\nRohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh.

In many cases, this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries. Though perhaps effective in combating the disease’s spread, these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries. The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent, where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. As a result, and in order to curb the spread of the disease, the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.[15] In some cases, this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place. The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability. Africa will be disproportionately impacted, as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent.\n\nThe Horn of Africa\n\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability; conflict and the threat of terrorism; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity. Now, they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29, Somalia had three, Ethiopia had 19, and Kenya had 38 confirmed cases.[16] Kenya also confirmed its first death—a 66-year-old Kenyan man who also suffered from diabetes.[17] Meanwhile, the region is home to approximately 5.3 million IDPs and 2.5 million refugees, who are likely to be hit hardest.[18]\n\nAbsent robust public education campaigns about the coronavirus, rumors and false information are spreading rapidly. Fast and accurate information is critical in areas where the health infrastructure is weak and does not have the capacity to face an outbreak. In Ethiopia, which is host to more than 900,000 refugees and more than 2.6 million IDPs,[19] popular sentiment has violently turned against foreigners, who are being blamed for spreading the disease.[20] In Ethiopia’s western Oromia region—where intercommunal violence has displaced thousands—a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services is further restricting the ability to provide information on the virus.[21] In addition to limiting information on COVID-19, this inhibits communication among families, doctors, and their patients.\n\nHealth experts are concerned that the outbreak in Somalia, with an IDP population of more than 2.6 million and more than 16,000 refugees, could be among the worst in the world.[22] Decades of conflict have ravaged the country’s health system and other institutions and governance is weak. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, controls large swaths of territory, limiting the state’s reach and humanitarian workers’ access to populations in need.[23] Because there are no kits to test for COVID-19 in the country, samples must be sent to South Africa for analysis, significantly delaying results and thus the ability to track the disease.[24]\n\nThe government in Somalia has halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings, but the measures are not well-enforced.[25] To date, Al-Shabaab does not appear to have implemented measures in the regions it controls. Meanwhile, Somalia’s sizable displaced population is particularly at risk.[26] Humanitarian workers warn that the consequences could be devastating for the 3,000 families living in Nabadoon camp, outside Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu.[27] There, a lack of access to clean water, healthcare, and information, as well as cramped living conditions, will facilitate the spread of disease should an outbreak occur. In addition, continued conflict will complicate efforts to reach affected populations as the virus spreads.\n\nCentral Africa\n\nNigeria, where over 2 million people are internally displaced in the country’s northeast, was the first central African state to report cases of the virus. As of March 29, there were 97 confirmed cases of COVID-19.[28] Neighboring Cameroon had confirmed 91 cases, as it grapples with a series of crises that have forced 922,000 of its citizens into internal displacement.[29] Both governments have more capacity than many of their neighbors and could play a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. The Nigerian government should be applauded for working with UN leadership in the country to coordinate response efforts there. Unfortunately, other governments across the region have not done likewise.\n\nCountries like Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) were reporting three cases in each country as of March 29; however, given the limitations of their health systems, it is uncertain if these are indicative of the actual trend.[30] The outbreak’s impact could be disastrous if the coronavirus spreads beyond the capital cities, especially for the displaced populations in both countries. There are more than half a million IDPs in CAR and 171,000 IDPs in Chad, as well as 468,000 refugees from neighboring countries.[31] These vulnerable populations have little access to clean water or healthcare facilities.\n\nMen stand outside a house in a district that welcomes internally displaced people (IDP) from northern Burkina Faso.

The coronavirus has the potential to put immense pressure on already strained national health services and healthcare provided by humanitarian actors. The situation in Burkina Faso provides a window into the nature of the challenge that could confront neighboring Mali and Niger. There are currently 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Eleven deaths have been reported, including that of Marie Rose Compaore, the second vice-president of the National Assembly. It is only a matter of time before the disease spreads to the country’s more than half a million IDPs.[32]\n\nAs of March 29, Mali and Niger had both reported 18 cases of COVID-19. However, the lack of infrastructure in both countries prevents both the effective detection and containment of the disease. Moreover, the internally displaced populations in both countries—171,000 people in Mali, and 187,000 in Niger—are not in camps and frequently relocate because of spreading violence.[33] This could increase the likelihood of the virus reaching them and other groups on the move.\n\nAcross the region, humanitarian funding is in short supply and displaced populations already lacks access to health services, water, and sanitation. Basic measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization—such as stringent hand washing with soap and water and social distancing—are largely impractical in this context. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had planned to host a donor conference for the Sahel in mid-June to secure badly needed funding for the emergency. However, the conference has now been postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nIn the Great Lakes Region, 30 people in Uganda, 60 in Rwanda, and 65 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had tested positive for COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020.[34] With over 5 million displaced persons (the vast majority of whom are IDPs), the DRC has the largest number of displaced people in the region.[35] The first week of March 2020 marked the end of the DRC’s two-year-long Ebola outbreak. But the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. As the DRC grapples with the spread of this new pandemic, it is important that health facilities built to respond to the Ebola outbreak be repurposed to treat cases of COVID-19. While discussions to that effect have already begun, very little action has been taken. NGOs are beginning to integrate messaging about the coronavirus into their current programs. However, planning and implementation must be accelerated.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nFollowing years of civil war, nearly one-third of South Sudan’s population remains displaced—there are about 1.47 million IDPs in South Sudan and 2.2 million refugees in neighboring countries.[36] With more than half the population facing acute food insecurity and poor health infrastructure, South Sudan is highly vulnerable to the spread and harmful effects of infectious diseases. No cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the country as of publication of this report, but several cases had been confirmed in neighboring countries. To prevent and prepare for a possible outbreak, South Sudan has suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders to all but cargo buses, food trucks, and fuel tanks.[37]\n\nThe presence of a large UN peacekeeping mission with significant staff rotations in South Sudan adds an additional potential vector for the disease to spread to the country. Almost 200,000 IDPs live in Protection of Civilian sites on or near peacekeeping bases.[38] The UN and troop contributing countries are taking steps to limit the potential for exposure, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan.[39]\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had significant implications for major humanitarian hotspots across the Americas. To date, the response by governments has varied widely. Countries like Peru, Guatemala, and Colombia implemented strong measures early to combat the spread of the virus.[40] However, Mexico and Brazil have been slow to adopt mitigation measures, even dismissing the severity of the crisis.[41] In Central America, many countries have adopted stricter border policies but have acquiesced to demands from the United States to continue receiving deported nationals. Many countries in South America have closed their borders to the movement of people, including for displaced Venezuelans.\n\nThe U.S. Border\n\nThe United States now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.[42] Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court dates there. This was done under the Trump administration’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the “Remain in Mexico” program.[43] These asylum seekers—mostly from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela—were returned to unsafe conditions in Mexico, and left to await their hearings in ill-equipped shelters and informal open-air encampments where disease could spread rapidly. In addition, there were 15,000 individuals waiting to seek asylum outside U.S. ports of entry as of February 2020. These individuals—three quarters of whom are Mexican—were living in the same grim conditions as those impacted by the MPP program.[44]\n\nOn March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures in response to the pandemic. No exceptions are being made for asylum seekers or unaccompanied minors. The border closure empowers DHS to immediately turn back to Mexico or repatriate to their home countries other than Mexico all asylum seekers without due process—a clear violation of U.S. obligations under domestic and international law.[45] These measures were instituted well after introduction of the virus to the United States. They have impeded the ability of humanitarian workers to bring critical supplies to Mexico. In addition, some of the shelters housing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border have been forced to close because of the virus.[46]\n\nAs a result of the border closures, the United States has already begun to turn away or repatriate all migrants lacking documents authorizing their entry—including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors—to countries including Mexico,[47] Guatemala,[48] Honduras,[49] and Ecuador. Authorities are not screening individuals to determine if they are victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of persecution in their home countries. Nor are they taking precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Mexican government has agreed to accept most Central American returnees (though not unaccompanied minors).[50] It is not clear if the United States or Mexico intends to arrange the deportation of others, such as Venezuelans or Cubans, in lieu of allowing them to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMoreover, many of the NGOs that typically play a crucial monitoring role at the U.S. border have been forced to reduce or cease operations in light of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. This makes it crucial that the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) monitor returns and conditions along the border. Despite U.S. government restrictions on travel and commerce, the delivery of critical humanitarian supplies to Mexico should be considered “essential” and allowed to continue.\n\nThe rule closing the border is predicated on the false assumption that the only possible alternative to turning away asylum seekers is detaining them in unsafe, overcrowded border facilities for lengthy periods of time. In fact, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency could instead expeditiously parole asylum seekers into the United States, where the vast majority have ties to families, friends, or faith-based communities.[51] In the weeks ahead, U.S. border officials should allow people to follow the U.S. legal process to request asylum and provide screening and referral to health facilities if necessary. Asylum seekers should then be released to homes and NGO-run shelters, through parole or other community-based alternatives to detention, where they can appropriately socially distance and be permitted to continue their cases in immigration court when the courts resume operations.[52] CBP should screen unaccompanied minors and send then to the Office of Refugee Resettlement which must, according to a new court order, quickly plan to release them to sponsors.[53]\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people. Asylum seekers and other forced migrants come primarily from Central America, but also from South America and Africa. They are often at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus because of their living conditions. Many are detained in detention centers known as “migratory stations,” stay in privately-run shelters while they await their asylum claims in Mexico to be processed, or, as described above, live in informal camps on the northern border while they await their court hearings in the United States.\n\nMexico has 848 registered cases of COVID-19.[54] Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for long ignoring the crisis, even traveling across the country and holding gatherings with large crowds. Now, the government has begun to take steps to contain the virus, such as calling for Mexicans to stay in their homes for a month[55] and limiting tourism.[56] It is also working to reduce overcrowding among the migrant and forcibly displaced populations in migratory stations across the country.[57] However, the government continues to accept the return of Mexicans deported from the United States despite inadequate health screenings prior to deportation. Grim conditions and the absence of healthcare and other services in the informal camps where they often stay are perhaps of greatest concern.\n\nThe Mexican authorities must more aggressively encourage practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and President López Obrador should lead by example. In migratory stations, specifically, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INAMI) should continue to implement mitigation measures and reduce the number of detained migrants when possible, with support from independent civil society organizations. The Mexican government has indicated that it would suspend the processing of asylum requests until April 20. However, it should resume these operations as soon as possible. In the interim, Mexico should ensure that asylum seekers whose claims are on hold have access to adequate shelter and healthcare, including testing for COVID-19. Mexico should not be expected to accept asylum seekers returned under the MPP program until basic safeguards can be put in place to protect the health of returnees.\n\nCentral America\n\nThe countries of Central America grapple with extreme violence and lack institutional capacity to respond to a pandemic. Civilians eager to escape violence have no recourse, prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Meanwhile, hundreds of Central Americans are deported from the United States each week.\n\nGuatemala has confirmed 34 cases COVID-19.[58] On March 16, the government suspended all international flights and closed the borders for 15 days.[59] On March 17, it announced the temporary suspension of transfers of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the United States to Guatemala under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). (The United States has used the ACA to bar asylum seekers from applying for protection in the United States, instead sending them to Guatemala.) The Guatemalan government initially announced that it would suspend the acceptance of Guatemalan nationals deported by the Unites States. However, it reversed this decision in a just a matter of days and deportations of Guatemalans have resumed. The Guatemalan government is warning its citizens that they will be immediately deported if they attempt to go to the United States.[60]\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced that the country would bar entry to all foreigners, except accredited diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for patients with COVID-19 and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the United States on March 18.[61] Nonetheless, deportation flights to El Salvador have continued.[62] As of March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the United States.[63]\n\nThe Guatemalan government should remain firm in its decision to halt transfers of asylum seekers under the ACA. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unreasonable to forcibly send Salvadorans and Hondurans asylum seekers to a country, Guatemala, that cannot provide them with adequate safety and security. In cases of deportation of Guatemalan, Salvadoran, or Honduran migrants who have not made claims to asylum, the United States should adopt comprehensive screenings prior to departures to ensure safety of other deportees and to avoid overwhelming these countries’ fragile health systems during this public health crisis. Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who test positive should not be deported.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis\n\nUnder the regime of President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have suffered years of economic collapse, institutional failure, and political turmoil. Hyperinflation, generalized violence, and political repression are rife in a country where the vast majority live in poverty. In February 2020, the UN World Food Program stated that 9.3 million people in Venezuela—about one-third of the population—faced food insecurity.[64] As more than 4.9 million people have fled the country, over 1 million children have been left without their parents.[65]\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 119 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Venezuela. Although World Health Organization records do not indicate any deaths, Venezuelan officials have confirmed at least one death.[66] A “social quarantine” has been established nation-wide, and military forces have been deployed throughout the country to enforce restrictions on movement. Nevertheless, not all citizens are complying, as small crowds continue to line up to obtain food and other essential goods. On March 24, the government ordered stricter isolation measures in the three states—Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas—that account for 70 percent of COVID-19 cases.[67] The country’s years-long economic crisis has left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse.[68] Hospitals lack adequate facilities, medical personnel, supplies, and medication.[69] For the public, face masks, soap, and even water for hand-washing[70] are either unavailable or unaffordable.[71]\n\nNicolás Maduro has called on the United States to lift its sanctions on the country in order to open access to foreign investments and finance that could help fund a response. Human rights groups, and EU leaders,[72] as well as the UN Secretary-General[73] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights[74] have echoed these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges in a move it could use to justify additional sanctions.[75] Maduro also tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from a special emergency fund of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[76] President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits,[77] and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help.[78] Meanwhile, Maduro’s long-held opposition to international aid organizations will further heighten the likelihood that the outbreak does outsized damage.\n\nThe pandemic risks exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela—a crisis that has already compelled millions from Venezuelans to seek refuge in other countries.[79] As the situation deteriorates, more Venezuelans are likely to try to flee to neighboring Colombia and Brazil. Faced with official border closings, they may instead resort to taking dangerous unofficial routes out of the country, known as trochas, that are often controlled by armed groups. Those who are able to cross irregularly will, in turn, have trouble accessing the care they need in their host countries, and thus risk further spreading the virus.\n\nVenezuelans in Colombia\n\nAs of March 29, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside Colombia had risen to 608, with six deaths reported.[80] That day, after several temporary “quarantine drills” in parts of the country, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect.[81] As of March 17, the government had closed the country’s borders. Colombia is host to the largest number of displaced Venezuelans, by far—according to official reports, more than 1.7 million Venezuelans were in Colombia as of December 31, 2019. Since the start of the displacement crisis, the Colombian government has maintained a relatively generous response.[82] However, as the international response to the Venezuelan displacement crisis remains acutely underfunded and Colombia faces its own economic challenges, the situation has begun to stress the country’s public services—including the healthcare system. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate these challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia is likely to be severe. First, despite the fact that Venezuelans have the right to free emergency healthcare in Colombia regardless of their immigration status, many cannot access that care because facilities lack capacity or because health workers are unaware of Venezuelans’ rights or even discriminate against them. Those who have regular status and are able to obtain insurance may have an easier time accessing care, and a broader range of care. Nevertheless, the majority of Venezuelans in Colombia have been unable to regularize their status. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status is only expected to increase as a result of the border closing. As indicated above, Venezuelans desperate for aid may instead resort to using informal channels to enter Colombia.[83]\n\nMany Venezuelans—including the pendulares who still live in Venezuela and cross frequently into Colombia to purchase goods or attend school—rely heavily on aid provided by international organizations and NGOs near the border. However, as part of the measures to close the border, the Colombian government ordered NGOs in the area to cut their capacity by half.[84] Moreover, on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced that gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited.[85] The restriction will inevitably impact organizations’ ability to operate in centers where Venezuelans shelter or gather to seek aid.\n\nTwo young Venezuelans with face marks cross the Rumichaca Bridge on the border between Colombia and Ecuador.

According to the latest official figures, Peru is host to the second largest number of Venezuelans (861,000 as of February 7, 2020).[86] As of December 31, 2019, Ecuador is host to 366,596 Venezuelans.\n\nOn March 15, Ecuador—where 1,823 cases and 48 deaths have now been reported—closed its borders to all foreign travelers.[87] Gatherings of more than 30 people were also banned.[88] In Peru, where 671 cases have been confirmed,[89] Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra also declared a state of emergency on March 15 and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days.[90] Four days later, the government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles.[91]On March 25, President Vizcarra extended a state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12.[92]\n\nThese border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries. For Venezuelans already inside these host countries, limited access to healthcare, loss of their livelihoods, and limits on movement and available services will put them at higher risk of infection or complications.\n\nOn March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.[93] President Bolsonaro has been criticized for his lax response to the pandemic, raising fears that the toll inside the country will be high.[94]Already, by March 25, there were 2,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths. The latest official figures indicate that Brazil was host to more than 250,000 Venezuelans as of November 30, 2019, though the current number is likely much higher. Despite the government’s attempts to relocate Venezuelans who have crossed into the country, the majority remain concentrated in remote, impoverished areas along the northern border, where resources and infrastructure are sparse.[95] The inevitable damage from the coronavirus is thus likely to affect Venezuelans inside the country even as the border closing hinders others from accessing the critical healthcare they lack in Venezuela.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2018, there were nearly 2.5 million refugees and 646,060 asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) alone.[96] As of March 17, just 10 cases had been reported among refugees and asylum seekers, all of them in Germany. Already, however, countries had begun to close their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands had shut their asylum offices.[97] In other countries, including Italy, asylum services have significantly slowed. Due to health and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, NGOs have had to suspend search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those attempting to cross from war-torn Libya.[98] Meanwhile, nationalist leaders and politicians—from Italy to Spain—have seized upon the outbreak as a false basis for xenophobic, anti-refugee rhetoric and policies.[99]\n\nItaly\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 92,472 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 10,023 deaths—more deaths than in any other country. More than ten days after ordering a strict, nationwide lockdown, with the number of deaths surging, the Italian government called in the military on March 20 to enforce its approach.[100] On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited all non-essential movement within the country.[101] Even as the number of new cases in Italy began to slow, the government was expected to extend containment measures beyond the initial April 3 deadline.[102]\n\nThe impact on refugees and asylum seekers has been significant.[103] At the end of 2018, there were nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. Heeding lockdown and “social distancing” orders is difficult for these individuals, who often work in informal jobs, live in close quarters, and rely on government and NGO assistance. On March 12, the government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals of rejected asylum requests given court closures. By law, foreigners in Italy have access to healthcare. In practice, many asylum seekers fear going to hospitals if undocumented, or face discrimination or language barriers. All this will make it harder to detect the virus in a highly vulnerable population.\n\nGreece\n\nAs of March 29, Greece confirmed 1,156 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.[104] While this is less than several other European countries, the Greek government is concerned that if it does not act quickly, it could follow the trajectory of Italy. Greece has therefore enacted a country-wide lockdown, closing hotels and suspending most international flights.[105] The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has suspended all administrative services until April 13 at the earliest. This includes registering asylum seekers, conducting interviews, adjudicating cases, and reviewing appeals.\n\nThe shutdown of the entire Greek asylum system leaves all asylum seekers in a precarious position. Arguably, no population in Greece is more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the more than 40,000 asylum seekers trapped on the Aegean Islands.[106] Conditions are appalling in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) where asylum seekers are required to live. The official RICs and their overflow areas are squalid and overcrowded, hosting approximately eight times their capacity. These areas lack basic hygiene facilities, have very few latrines, and provide minimal medical care at best. There is no running water, making frequent hand washing impractical.\n\nMigrants living in the Moria camp sew handmade protective face masks on the Greek island of Lesbos, as the country is under lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Photo by MANOLIS LAGOUTARIS/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nNGOs on the islands report that no significant steps have been taken to prepare the camps for an outbreak of the coronavirus. Instead, the government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days.[107] These measures reduce essential services in the camps, including food distributions, childcare, and servicing latrines. Relief groups have been calling on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country in order to save the lives of asylum seekers and Greek citizens alike.[108] The EU has now echoed this call to evacuate the most vulnerable asylum seekers in the camps to other areas on the islands,[109] a crucial first step to protect asylum seekers and limit the likely spread in the camps.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is fast becoming an epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Cases have escalated dramatically in Lebanon and Iran. New infections have emerged in more than half a dozen other countries in the region including Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 12 million refugees and IDPs live in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. Borders throughout the Middle East are porous, with refugees, economic migrants, and others often traveling along informal routes. Another challenge to an effective coronavirus response is the region’s weak or broken public health systems.\n\nHowever, the situation also differs significantly between countries. Turkey, with over 3.4 million Syrian refugees, has a robust healthcare system and the government is somewhat better positioned to respond to an outbreak and employ basic containment tools like contact tracing. On the other hand, Iraq and Lebanon have severely weak public health systems and are not able to adequately monitor what is going on and provide a robust public health response.\n\nThe Syria Crisis\n\nSyria’s brutal war entered its tenth year last month. More than 5.6 million have fled Syria since 2011, and over 6.5 million remain displaced inside the country.[110] The majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced Syrians lack the most basic needs, including access to healthcare. Even the most basic guidance on social distancing and personal hygiene will be difficult to follow where refugees and IDPs often live in overcrowded and unhygienic camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe situation in the northwest of Syria is of particular concern. It will be extremely challenging to launch an effective response to a coronavirus outbreak in places like Idlib province. While no confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been announced in Idlib, this appears to be largely due to the lack of testing kits. At least three people who showed symptoms of COVID-19 died in the past week, and there are several other patients with the virus symptoms who are quarantined inside hospitals, a doctor and a representative of a medical organization in Idlib told Refugees International. More than 1 million people are staying in overcrowded and unhygienic camps where it is very challenging to impose social distancing.[111] Very few people are staying home. The economic situation is such that if people do not work, they do not have the means to feed their families. Moreover, there is no authority inside Idlib that has the means to enforce preventive measures, and the various fighting factions on the ground appear to have other priorities.\n\nSyrians are seen on the mud covered road between tents at a refugee camp after heavy rain in Idlib, Syria. Syrian refugees, who have been living in the camp, face flooding, mud, and puddles due to lack of infrastructure and sewerage network.

The facilities that remain will have little of the equipment required to treat coronavirus patients, such as ventilators, or to protect healthcare workers from infection as they go about their duties. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to the northwest.[112] The main challenge is that the whole area has only around 100 ventilators. Efforts to screen populations with infrared non-contact thermometers are also necessary. Any type of support for the general capacity of what remains of the medical system in northwest Syria could make a significant difference.\n\nOutside of Syria, more needs to be done now to help prepare the camps and communities that host Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Countries like Lebanon, host to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, are already experiencing significant outbreaks that are taxing their national healthcare systems. Jordan hosts the second largest Syrian refugee population per capita in the world. Because these refugees are unlikely to be a top priority for the national authorities, the international humanitarian community must step in to fill the gaps, in collaboration with host governments.\n\nIraq\n\nDecades of conflict and widespread violence have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of civilians in Iraq. According to UNHCR, more than 6.5 million people—approximately 18 percent of the population—are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children.[113] Nearly 2 million people remain displaced inside the country, the majority of whom have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Moreover, Iraq is host to around 300,000, mostly Syrian, refugees.[114] Many live inside camps where poor conditions and outdated infrastructure could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.[115]\n\nAs of March 29, 547 cases of confirmed coronavirus had been reported in Iraq.[116] However, the real number was likely much higher. The country’s health system, undermined by decades of sanctions, neglect, corruption and violence, suffers from significant gaps including shortages of supplies, equipment, and staff.[117] To prevent further spread of the virus, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights. However, security forces are struggling to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims from across the country visit shrines in the capital.[118] In addition, humanitarian actors have reported that curfews and movement restrictions are impacting the delivery of assistance to people in need.[119]\n\nHumanitarian groups in Iraq have developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response planning in the camps. Moreover, UN agencies are supporting Iraq with testing capacities and the procurement of personal protective equipment for health partners. Donors and humanitarian organizations should increase their efforts to support Iraq and the KRI government’s response. They should offer personnel support to fill staff shortages and provide the necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nYemen\n\nThe WHO announced that, so far, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Yemen.[120] However, a virus outbreak will almost certainly have a devastating effect. Yemen hosts what may be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million people in need of assistance, and nearly 3.65 million internally displaced.[121] A relentless war has decimated the country’s healthcare system. In the past few years, Yemen has witnessed the worst cholera epidemic in recent history.[122]\n\nLast week, both the Houthi rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognized government banned international flights in an attempt to keep the country free of the coronavirus.[123] The ban includes chartered medical evacuations. Despite the halt to passenger flights, the UN-led Yemen aid operation continues for the moment, with the vast majority of staff being Yemeni. The UN confirmed that seaports remain open for cargo. Yemen is largely reliant on cargo arriving by sea for imports of food, fuel, and other consumer essentials critical to civilian welfare.\n\nThe WHO is supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the coronavirus with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. However, some international relief teams have scaled back to essential staff only. A fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients to limit aid fraud has been paused.[124] Top priority, life-saving assistance such as food, water, sanitation, and health services will continue, but some less critical aid programs will be slowed. The international humanitarian community must step in to help Yemen’s medical personnel to prepare for a virus outbreak. It should particularly provide medical facilities with testing kits, medical equipment, and supplies in addition to personnel protective gear to help protect healthcare workers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe challenge of containing and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world’s most vulnerable, displaced populations is breathtaking in scope. Each humanitarian crisis will require a strategy tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the displaced population in question – a strategy that is workable in a context that will undoubtedly include significant resource constraints. That said, there are common elements across the countries and continents reviewed above, which lend themselves to key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nThe response must be inclusive: The response to COVID-19 must be inclusive if it is to be effective. International assistance to address the pandemic must reach all vulnerable populations, including the refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced. Governments receiving U.S. assistance for COVID-19 should ensure that the forcibly displaced living in both camp and non-camp settings are included in prevention and mitigation efforts. By the same token, aid for refugees and internally displaced people to address the COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to host communities in refugee-hosting areas. In short, the aim should be to improve systems for all persons regardless of nationality.\n\nEnhance communications and the flow of information: Governments and international aid groups should develop information campaigns to ensure displaced communities have accurate and current information about the coronavirus and response efforts. Where possible, they should work with local civil society and displaced persons themselves to ensure language and means of communications are easily accessible and widely disseminated. Governments should lift any phone and internet restrictions in and around displaced communities.\n\nDeploy medical personnel, supplies, and personal protective equipment: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize the deployment of qualified medical personnel to refugee, asylum seeker, and IDP-dense areas, along with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as gloves and masks for humanitarian health workers to ensure their safety in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in displacement camps. Appropriate training for existing health care personnel must occur, particularly for treatment of severe cases with limited ICU access.\n\nPrioritize hygiene and other WASH-related interventions: Donors and international aid groups should improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for refugee and internally displaced populations – especially those living in camps or camp-like settings. This should include the distribution of essential personal hygiene items including soap and disposable towels. The response should also recognize best practices for response for particularly vulnerable populations, such as women and girls.\n\nFocus on decongestion and isolation and quarantine capacities: Donors, host governments, and international aid groups should prioritize decongestion and building isolation and quarantine capacities in camps and camp-like settings. Services like food distribution and education should be restructured to avoid large gatherings. Donors and others should take steps now to support establishment of capabilities within displaced communities for implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures in accordance with best medical and public health advice and practices. Given the extremely high density of certain settings, novel strategies for “shielding” may need to be carefully attempted.\n\nBuild up testing and surveillance capabilities: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize deployment of rapid testing capability in adequate quantity to refugee and IDP settings. With respect to surveillance, the good news is that many formal camps already have epidemiological surveillance systems already in place. These need to be strengthened and adapted to screen for COVID-19, especially for all new arrivals in the camps.\n\nStop detentions and deportations of asylum seekers: Public health officials universally agree that detention in crowded facilities increases the risk of transmission for asylum seekers and immigrants in custody, along with immigration and border officials. Governments should put in place alternatives to detention polices and ensure that all migrants have access to testing and healthcare regardless of status. Deportation of any individuals without prior medical testing risks exporting the virus into countries unprepared to deal with mass outbreaks because of pre-existing crises and substantial vulnerable and marginalized populations with little access to limited healthcare systems.\n\nProtect those who fear persecution from forced return: Any restrictions that governments impose on travel should include provisions that safeguard individuals from forced return to torture or persecution. Moreover, extraordinary policy measures that impose unusual burdens for those seeking asylum should be lifted as soon as circumstances permit. In times of national emergency, protecting vulnerable people from gross abuses of their basic rights can become far more challenging for governments, but it is at those very times when our commitment to such rights is decisively measured.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nRefugees International would like to thank the following people for their contributions to this report:\n\nTony Banbury , President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems\n\n, President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems Chris Beyrer , Desmond M.

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening lives and economies around the world.\n\nBut it has also demonstrated that human societies are capable of transforming themselves more or less overnight.\n\nFour experts say now is the time to usher in systemic economic change.\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus has forced entire countries into lockdown mode, terrified citizens around the world, and triggered a financial-market meltdown. The pandemic demands a forceful, immediate response. But in managing the crisis, governments also must look to the long term. One prominent policy blueprint with a deep time horizon is the European Commission’s European Green Deal, which offers several ways to support the communities and businesses most at risk from the current crisis.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises are coming. If we muddle through each new crisis while maintaining the same economic model that got us here, future shocks will eventually exceed the capacity of governments, financial institutions, and corporate crisis managers to respond. Indeed, the “coronacrisis” has already done so.\n\nThe Club of Rome issued a similar warning in its famous 1972 report, The Limits to Growth, and again in Beyond the Limits, a 1992 book by the lead author of that earlier report, Donella Meadows. As Meadows warned back then, humanity’s future will be defined not by a single emergency but by many separate yet related crises stemming from our failure to live sustainably. By using the Earth’s resources faster than they can be restored, and by releasing wastes and pollutants faster than they can be absorbed, we have long been setting ourselves up for disaster.\n\nCOVID-19 reflects a broader trend: more planetary crises - like climate change are coming. Image: European Comission\n\nOn one planet, all species, countries, and geopolitical issues are ultimately interconnected. We are witnessing how the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China can wreak havoc on the entire world. Like COVID-19, climate change, biodiversity loss, and financial collapses do not observe national or even physical borders. These problems can be managed only through collective action that starts long before they become full-blown crises.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call to stop exceeding the planet’s limits. After all, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change all make pandemics more likely. Deforestation drives wild animals closer to human populations, increasing the likelihood that zoonotic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 will make the cross-species leap. Likewise, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that global warming will likely accelerate the emergence of new viruses.\n\nGovernments that succeed in containing epidemics all tacitly follow the same mantra: “Follow the science and prepare for the future.” But we can do much better. Rather than simply reacting to disasters, we can use the science to design economies that will mitigate the threats of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemics. We must start investing in what matters, by laying the foundation for a green, circular economy that is anchored in nature-based solutions and geared toward the public good.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis shows us that it is possible to make transformational changes overnight. We have suddenly entered a different world with a different economy. Governments are rushing to protect their citizens medically and economically in the short term. But there is also a strong business case for using this crisis to usher in global systemic change.\n\nFor example, there is no good reason not to be phasing out fossil fuels and deploying renewable energy technologies, most of which are now globally available and already cheaper than fossil fuels in many cases. With the recent oil-price plunge, perverse fossil-fuel subsidies can and should be eliminated, as the G7 and many European countries have pledged to do by 2025.\n\nShifting from industrial to regenerative agriculture also is immediately feasible, and would allow us to sequester carbon in the soil at a rate that is sufficient to reverse the climate crisis. Moreover, doing so would turn a profit, enhance economic and environmental resilience, create jobs, and improve wellbeing in both rural and urban communities.\n\nRegenerative agriculture features prominently in many of the new economic models that are now being explored by city governments around the world – all of which are based on the principle of living within our planetary boundaries. As one of us (Raworth) argues in advancing her idea of “Doughnut Economics,” the goal should be to create a “safe and just operating space for all of humanity.” In other words, we must work within the planet’s natural limits (the outer boundary of the doughnut) while also ensuring that marginalized communities do not fall behind (into the doughnut hole).\n\nFor policymakers responding to the current crisis, the goal should be to support citizens’ livelihoods by investing in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Now is the time to start redirecting the $5.2 trillion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies every year toward green infrastructure, reforestation, and investments in a more circular, shared, regenerative, low-carbon economy.",

        "content": "The worldwide spread of the new disease known as COVID-19 has created a global health crisis unseen in modern times, triggering dramatic efforts to slow its spread. Here is what scientists know – and what they are racing to learn – about COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that is part of the coronavirus family, whose members typically cause the common cold. About 80% of people who become ill have mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough and fatigue, and recover, according to a study of 70,000 COVID-19 patients in China. About 15 to 20% develop serious illness. Those who become severely ill often develop pneumonia and difficulty breathing, and many require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited a study found that the overall death rate in China was 2.3%, but much higher death rates were seen in at-risk groups like those older than 80 years (15%) and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nPeople older than 60 years of age are at increased risk of serious illness from COVID-19, explained Nancy Messonnier, MD, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in a recent press briefing. People older than 80 have the highest risk of serious illness and death. Only 2% of the cases in the study from China occurred among children. People with underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, also have elevated risks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nWhat causes COVID-19?\n\nOn Dec. 31, the WHO was notified of a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in China. A week later, Chinese authorities identified SARS-CoV-2 as the new coronavirus causing the infections, according to the WHO. It has quickly spread around the globe, with hundreds of thousands of confirmed infections and thousands of deaths.\n\nWhat are coronaviruses?\n\nCoronaviruses sometimes cross over from animals to humans. In some cases, these coronavirus crossovers begin spreading among humans and a few have caused serious respiratory illnesses. In 2002, a coronavirus that jumped from civet cats to humans caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). A decade later, a coronavirus that crossed from dromedary camels to humans caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak. SAR-CoV disappeared by 2004, though MERS-CoV continues to circulate in camels, according to NIAID. The exact source of the currently circulating novel coronavirus is unknown, but a recent genetic analysis suggests it is most closely related to coronaviruses circulating in bats.\n\nWhy is SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous?\n\nBecause humans have never been exposed to this new coronavirus before, they have essentially no immunity, Dr. Messioner said at the press briefing. As a result, it has spread exponentially, with thousands of cases reported across all 50 states by mid-March.\n\n“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person-to-person based on the available data,” she said at the briefing. Small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person can infect others when they breathe in the droplets or touch surfaces the droplets have landed on and then touch their face, according to the WHO. People without symptoms may also spread the virus, the CDC notes, accounting for the recommendations some officials are making to drastically curb social interaction.\n\nWhy are we seeing strict public health measures in response to COVID-19?\n\nBecause the virus is so infectious and is spreading at exponential rates, public health authorities are concerned that the demand for care for people who become seriously ill could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. To help prevent this, the CDC and the federal government are working with state and local authorities on strict public health measures to slow the spread of the virus such as recommending that people avoid social gatherings with more than 10 people and suggesting that those who are not employed in critical industries work from home if they can. In some areas, officials have required bars and restaurants to close and for residents, with some exceptions, to stay home. The idea is to “flatten the curve” – to slow the rate of new infections in the population – so that fewer people become sick at once and hospitals can keep up.\n\nAre people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 immune after they recover?\n\nSo far, there are limited data available on whether people who have been infected develop immunity or if they can become reinfected. But during his testimony to Congress, NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD ‘66, said, “if this acts like any other virus once you recover, you won’t get reinfected.”\n\nHow is COVID-19 treated?\n\nThere are currently no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, so doctors are relying on supportive care to help patients recover, according to the WHO. There are also no vaccines currently available that would protect people from becoming infected. But clinical trials are underway to test potential treatments and vaccines, though they are likely months away from being widely available. For example, clinical trials are underway in China of a drug called remdesivir, which was developed to treat MERS-CoV, according to NIAID, and manufacturer Gilead will provide the drug outside of the trials for certain severely ill patients, pregnant women and children, STAT News reported.\n\nClinical studies are also underway to see whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs currently used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, or a drug called sarilumab, a drug that might reduce the lung inflammation, are safe and effective against COVID-19, according to the FDA. Some scientists, however, have urged caution about the potential use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials until data about their efficacy is confirmed. As of March 20th, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists were reporting shortages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially putting at risk patients in need of these drugs for established diseases.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has also launched an early clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said Dr. Fauci in the announcement about the vaccine trial.",

        "content": "Leadership matters. Competence matters. Preparation matters—especially when you’re given advance warning.\n\nAbove all, organized action by a capable government matters. It’s what happened during past natural disasters, financial crises, and terrorist attacks. Although the responses were far from perfect, this was the norm for the 6 administrations that I served in as a nonpartisan senior official.\n\nAs citizens, we have every right to expect that President Trump and his administration would have spent January through mid-March mobilizing for COVID-19 as a looming natural disaster. Instead, the Trump administration wasted precious time minimizing the threat (“We have it totally under control.”) despite clear, advance warning. Reports in December of COVID-19 in China should have triggered intensive preparation for testing to detect and contain the disease (as was done in South Korea). And before that, an October 2019 US government report summarized months of exercises that simulated a pandemic of respiratory disease (influenza, in that case), according to The New York Times. The report analyzed the magnitude of the potential disaster, identifying massive shortfalls in equipment, supplies, facilities, and the supply chain.\n\nAppropriate preparation would have markedly reduced deaths and economic devastation. Empty (if not misleading) rhetoric cannot substitute for concerted action among federal, state, and local agencies. Waiting until mid-March to begin putting ourselves on a wartime footing was way too little, way too late.\n\nThe earliest COVID-19 hotspot in the US—the Seattle area—provides an inspiring case study illustrating how leadership, honest communication, and concerted action make a huge difference, even if it doesn’t result in a panacea. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, local elected leaders, and public health officials all deserve enormous kudos for their responsible actions. Recent articles in GQ, The New York Times, and Kaiser Health News detail how physician-scientists at the University of Washington anticipated the impending crisis, developed a COVID-19 test, and invested millions of dollars to create testing capacity, overcoming bureaucratic inertia at FDA and CDC. By March 13, the University of Washington clinical laboratory had conducted 3 of every 10 COVID-19 tests done in the nation. UW leaders worked closely with the health department, elected officials, and local leaders to prepare for the challenges, marshal resources, adapt to changing demands, and solve emerging problems. While the situation in the Seattle area remains critical, everyone has come together the way we all should to deal with a crisis.\n\n\n\nLeadership organizes our responses to a crisis, enabling effective action and inspiring heroic contributions. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has been an effective, bipartisan leader, mandating “social distancing,” communicating a calm but consistent message about the public health emergency and visibly relying on Amy Acton, MD, MPH, the Ohio Public Health Department director. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders have implemented unprecedented actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepare the health care system, including “stay at home” orders and the rapid addition of hospital capacity. And in straightforward, factual briefings attracting a wide audience, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has conveyed the magnitude of the public health crisis threatening his state and New York City, laying out the desperate plight of hospitals, the shortfall in supplies and equipment, the importance of slowing the spread of the contagion, and the overwhelming need for federal action.\n\nHaving missed the opportunity to contain COVID-19, our leaders must act to mitigate its spread and devastation. Effective action requires clear, consistent communication dictated by public health and science, not public relations. All levels of government must work together seamlessly, driven by the mission, not worries about bureaucratic turf. Action must be immediate and overwhelming. Continuing failures to fully mobilize all available federal resources and powers will add immeasurably to the human and economic toll.\n\nTime is truly of the essence. Delay costs lives. Leadership matters. It’s that simple.\n\nSteven M.

        "content": "Allie Funk is a research analyst and Isabel Linzer a research associate at Freedom House. Last Tuesday, Moscow banned gatherings with more than 5,000 attendees until April 10, arguing that the move was necessary to limit the spread of covid-19. While such restrictions may be essential during a public health emergency, the announcement came on the same day President Vladimir Putin endorsed a proposal allowing him to remain in office until 2036. In Russia’s largest city — where the opposition has previously mobilized tens of thousands of people despite government efforts to suppress them and where there were just 20 confirmed cases across the country at that point — the decision to restrict free assembly is worthy of scrutiny.\n\nRussia is not alone. Authorities worldwide are using the coronavirus as a pretext to crack down on human rights for political purposes. Though some limitations are undoubtedly necessary to address a pandemic, there is a real risk that this crisis could trigger a lasting global backslide in fundamental freedoms — and it’s already started.\n\nFor example, while a pandemic creates an ideal situation for disinformation, many governments are using this threat to justify heavy censorship, smothering independent sources of information along with any legitimately harmful content. Iran, a leading Internet freedom violator, has become the epicenter of the Middle East’s coronavirus outbreak. During the government’s scramble to respond, Internet connectivity dipped and Wikipedia’s Farsi edition was temporarily blocked, according to civil society group Netblocks — just as similar blunt restrictions were imposed amid nationwide protests in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina has also deployed its sophisticated censorship apparatus against people contradicting the government’s narrative and those simply seeking health information. CitizenLab found 45 keywords censored across the live-streaming platform YY and 516 on WeChat, including “Wuhan + CCP + Crisis + Beijing” and “Supplementary + Western medicine + Coronavirus.” Given these platforms’ global user base, this silencing of information reaches far beyond China.\n\nAnd, using its controversial Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), Singapore ordered Facebook to restrict domestic access to the States Times Review’s page. While the page may have published some problematic coronavirus-related content, it is run by a government critic, and authorities have repeatedly invoked POFMA to suppress dissenting voices.\n\nMoreover, authorities are citing covid-19 to expand their monitoring capabilities beyond what is necessary for public health surveillance. In China, residents must use a new app that determines their health status, assigning a color-coded designation based on unspecified criteria to dictate whether they can move freely. It appears to automatically share users’ location with police. Moscow is following a similar playbook, using citywide, real-time facial recognition to identify people breaking quarantine. Over the past year, Muscovites have experienced protest-related arrests and connectivity disruptions, and this new biometric system will be used beyond tracking quarantine violators and long after the outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, like Moscow last week, some governments are restricting large gatherings to increase social distancing. In some cases, this may be necessary; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended such an action on Sunday. But not all countries have good records on free assembly. Despite reporting no cases within the country at the time, a Kyrgyzstan court originally banned mass rallies in Bishkek partly because of the coronavirus. The decision came just days after a protest in support of a jailed politician ended in a violent clash, with police arresting numerous attendees. The coronavirus was also cited to ban an International Women’s Day rally. Similarly, El Salvador barred gatherings with more than 500 people on Wednesday, even with no confirmed cases. Iraq, which has been rocked by protests for months, has also prohibited public gatherings.\n\nEven liberal democracies risk normalizing emergency measures. For example, to track infections, the United States reportedly pressured airlines to provide international travelers’ phone numbers and email addresses. It is important to communicate with and monitor infected passengers, but it is also crucial to ensure that any information collected is not misused and that these practices do not continue long after.\n\nCertain limitations on fundamental freedoms are unavoidable during public health crises. But such restrictions must be transparent, and necessary and proportionate to limiting the outbreak. Temporarily curbing mass gatherings can be justified, as long as authorities are transparent and provide details about when restrictions will be lifted. Yet much of the enhanced surveillance and censorship of recent weeks does not meet these standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf governments are allowed to impose indefinite and disproportionate restrictions on access to information, free expression, free assembly and privacy in the name of stopping covid-19, the negative effects will extend far beyond this outbreak. People will suffer a lasting deterioration in basic freedoms, and they will lose confidence in the institutions tasked with protecting them. That means that when the next public health threat emerges, both governments and citizens may be even less prepared to respond appropriately.",

USA TODAY\n\nEverything feels fragile. People, especially.\n\nAs the coronavirus spreads across the globe, there's recognition its toll will exceed the scope of the virus itself. Deaths will be caused by COVID-19 – closing in on 500 in the U.S. alone as of Monday – and long term health problems. Others will be frayed by the havoc, loneliness and financial insecurity caused by the disease.\n\nCoronavirus: What is social distancing? When should I quarantine versus isolate?\n\nThe data on past outbreaks and suicide is conflicting, but suicide prevention experts say it's reasonable to expect the current pandemic will lead to increased suicide risk for certain populations. Social distancing and quarantines may trigger those currently dealing with suicidal thoughts. And research shows the social and economic fallout from the pandemic may amplify the risk for some people well after the outbreak has ended.\n\nThose deaths will be harder to count.\n\n\"There are ramifications, sometimes fatal, with events like these that are not just related to getting infected or dying from infection or consequences of infection,\" said Eric Caine, co-director of the Center for the Study of Prevention of Suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is important \"to honestly and openly consider that there might be adverse events that occur in the midst of social distancing.\"\n\nSocial connection has become a crucial part of the language of suicide prevention. The more connected people are, experts say, the less likely they are to die by suicide. But the public health approach to stem the coronavirus requires people to forgo in-person connections – conversations, touch, the serendipitous encounters that make up the social fabric of people's lives.\n\nTips: 10 things to help you ease anxiety around coronavirus\n\nThe pandemic also has created major challenges around mental health care. Many therapists are no longer seeing clients in person, and not everyone has insurance that will cover telemedicine.\n\n\"Isolation is a big trigger for a lot of people,\" said Norine VanderHooven, a licensed clinical social worker in California. \"With SARS or H1N1 it was on such a different scale than what we're dealing with now. People are becoming so anxious because they don't know what to expect. Anxiety is fear of the unexpected or unknown.\"\n\nDanielle Sinay, 28, is a writer in Brooklyn who has a history of suicidal thoughts. She's been diagnosed with a panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While she isn't entirely isolated – she lives with her husband and four pets – disruptions to her routine and the proliferation of unknowns have left her vulnerable.\n\n\"It's so scary, it's almost like ... I would rather be dead,\" she said. \"I mean, I wouldn't be, but sometimes I get so scared it feels like that.\"\n\nNadine Kaslow, a professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of Medicine, said not all people who have experienced suicidal thoughts or survived previous attempts will react to the pandemic the same way.\n\nIf someone's suicidality stems from insecurities about self-esteem or self-worth, for example, the pandemic may not be as impactful as it would be for someone who has an anxiety disorder or suffers from catastrophic thinking.\n\n\"There is certainly going to be a group of people who are suicidal where this is just one more stress for them,\" Kaslow said. \"For others it could be a final stress, not even COVID itself, but everything that comes with it, all the financial stresses, trying to take care of kids at home, people you love dying, getting sick – the list goes on and on.\"\n\nThe ripple effects\n\nExperts caution there is no single cause of suicide. But getting laid off, losing a safe place to live and taking on new family responsibilities are the kinds of adversity that can elevate suicide risk.\n\nSelf-isolation: What do you do when the bigger danger is at home?\n\nLooking at a past disease outbreak like SARS in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 gives some indication of what may lie ahead. Social disengagement, stress and anxiety among some older adults resulted in an exceptionally high rate of suicide deaths, according to a 2010 study. Caine said Hong Kong's disrupted economy may have lead to increased suicides. He is concerned the U.S. may see the same.\n\nResearch shows unemployment is a risk factor for suicide. Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust, a national foundation committed to advancing mental health issues, said the virus outbreak already is bringing into sharp relief risk factors for poor health such as loneliness and social isolation.\n\n“Add to these social factors the possibility of an economic downturn, which may include job loss, and we are looking at a perfect storm of problems that will only exacerbate the deaths of despair that our nation still has not addressed,\" Miller said.\n\nVanderHooven said at least one of her clients attempted suicide because of impending job loss.\n\n\"We need to normalize people's feelings,\" she said. \"The truth is we don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTaking care of one another\n\nIn a moment like this, Caine said people can mitigate risk to vulnerable populations by doing their best to care for one another. The crisis is a collective one, not an individual one. No one should have to endure it alone.\n\n\"Even in the midst of social separation, there are ways where we can pull together to bring out warmth and cohesion,\" he said.\n\nCaine is encouraged by what he's seen already. Communities are mounting efforts to identify people at risk of isolation. Churches are reaching out. Parents are setting up Facebook groups to exchange information on (and to collectively lament the challenges of) homeschooling their kids. Local organizations are helping older adults with emergency needs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a sweeping multibillion-dollar emergency aid package last week that will provide paid sick leave for Americans who are in quarantine, helping a family member who is infected with COVID-19 or have children whose schools have closed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. More economic relief plans are underway.\n\nThese efforts, Caine said, will make a difference.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced many people to question the future and to some extent their mortality. For people struggling with suicidal ideation, existential questions are familiar. But Kaslow said it's possible that for some suicidal people, the coronavirus could end up being life-saving.\n\n\"There's going to be a group of people, I imagine, who are actually going to do better because somehow they are going to find a way to do something meaningful during this time,\" she said.\n\n\"They'll have to take care of their kids in a way they didn't have to before, or they'll be the one bringing food to people who are sick. Somehow in this national global crisis, they'll find a space to do something that matters. They'll find purpose.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center has compiled specific resources to support mental health and coping with the coronavirus.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nAlia E.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nProtesters had amassed in Washington, D.C., to reject the results of the Nov. 3 election, cheering as President Trump himself addressed the crowd and urged them to protest what he falsely claims was a rigged election before marching to the Capitol and pushing past security barriers there.\n\nThe protests are timed to coincide with Congress' certification of the Electoral College votes and aim to pressure Republican lawmakers into supporting Trump's effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nTrump supporters, many wearing red MAGA hats but no face masks, gathered at The Ellipse where the president addressed them midday Wednesday. The crowd faced the White House and a stage was flanked by two big \"Save America March\" signs swayed to the beat of the Village People song \"Macho Man\" and Michael Jackson's \"Billy Jean.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nAfter the speech, they pushed past barriers onto the Capitol grounds, while yelling, \"Whose Capitol? Our Capitol,\" NPR's Hannah Allam reports. Police and other security put up more barriers and security layers as protesters breached the initial security layer. Protesters climbed the scaffolding, looking for any way in to get to the Capitol, Allam said, and armed police rushed in tackling them.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs thousands of Trump supporters climbed up the side of the Capitol to get inside, bursts of what appeared to be gas cannisters are being fired though it was not clear who was firing them.\n\nEarlier, the mood was celebratory though the rhetoric was angry with speaker after speaker telling the crowd, \"We can't back down. This is just the beginning.\" The president's son Donald Trump Jr. greeted the crowd with: \"Hello, Patriots!\"\n\nOutside the U.S. Capitol, several dozen Trump supporters waved flags and prayed for \"angel armies\" to intervene, calling on lawmakers inside to \"reject\" the election.\n\nA huge contingent of Proud Boys marched in, some chanting \"storm the Capitol\" and \"1776!\" and massed for the Capitol building.\n\nFor many in the crowd, it was inconceivable that Congress would certify the November vote, as it's expected to. Echoing the president's words, they pledged to fight, some calling for a rebellion and others vowing to refocus energy on the 2024 race. And they made it clear that Republicans who didn't back Trump would pay a price.\n\n\"We're not moving on,\" said Lawrence Ligas, a 55-year-old from Chicago who said he used to be a Democrat before Trump \"earned\" his vote.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hannah Allam/NPR Hannah Allam/NPR\n\n\"We are not Republicans.

We are patriots,\" he said.\n\nNearby, 28-year-old Lisa Hayes was attracting a crowd with her outfit: a white tulle ballgown covered with mail-in ballots marked \"STOLEN.\"\n\n\"I am the 2020 election,\" Hayes said.\n\nAs she was explaining that the importance of election integrity brought her to Washington, a bystander interrupted and gestured toward her thin outfit in 43-degree weather.\n\n\"You're not freezing?\" he asked Hayes.\n\n\"My blood is boiling, so I'm fine!\" she replied.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMayor Bowser had said Wednesday that her city was ready to keep protests peaceful and protesters safe, even though Trump tweeted that Wednesday's protests would be \"wild.\"\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that the president himself has incited violence,\" said the mayor.\n\nPolice stablished a bigger \"traffic box\" a perimeter where vehicle traffic is restricted, she said, and, \"we have our entire police force activated\" along with National Guard and with help from other nearby jurisdictions, the mayor said.\n\n\"All of that is very expensive,\" said Bowser, \"we incur overtime costs when we do that.\"\n\nThe nation's capital is a cradle of protests, and Bowser says it's the city's responsibility to provide support for the movements of the president and the many demonstrations taking place in the Trump administration. The federal government hasn't paid its public safety bill in two years, but Bowser says she's confident that D.C. will be reimbursed.\n\n\"The federal government owes us about $100 million,\" she said. \"We will continue to work with the Congress to make sure we're made whole for our emergency fund.\"\n\nBowser also praised D.C. police for the arrest earlier this week of Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, leader of the far-right group Proud Boys. Tarrio has been barred from the District and is facing misdemeanor destruction of property charges and two felony counts of possession of high capacity firearm magazines.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by NPR, the magazines are AR-15/M4 compatible with a capacity of 30 rounds each, and every magazine is labeled with the Proud Boys insignia.\n\n\"I sell on my site,\" Tarrio told the officers who found the magazines in his bookbag. \"I had a customer that bought those two mags, and they got returned 'cause it was a wrong address. And I contacted him, and he's like, 'I'm going to be in D.C.,' so I'm like, 'OK, I'll take 'em to you.' \"\n\nProud Boys members typically dress in black and yellow, but are planning to wear all black, to mimic Antifa, a loose affiliation of far-left activists. The two groups have violently clashed in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police confirmed that permits for Wednesday's rally at The Ellipse had all been approved, including an amendment from 5,000 people to 30,000 people.\n\nEvery city police officer is on duty, and the city has also mobilized 300 members of its National Guard. The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department issued a traffic advisory that includes parking restrictions and street closures around downtown, a larger perimeter than in previous pro-Trump protests.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP\n\n\"My level of anxiety is high,\" D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in an interview with CBS News. \"My preparation is even more intense than that.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRacine's office is working with the FBI and others, but his main concern is that the Proud Boys will \"pick fights, create damage and then act in a very threatening way.\"\n\nOren Segal, vice president at the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, has been working and advising the D.C. government in preparation for Wednesday's protests.\n\n\"The stakes are higher today,\" he said.\n\nSegal says that Trump rallies appeal not only to extremists seeking to leverage a crisis, but also to people who show up merely in support of Trump, like the Muellers from Texas.\n\nThe concern was that nonviolent Trump supporters at these protests will \"get wrapped up in the tactics and violence of the extreme fringes\" because they are at a protest at the same time, he said.\n\nSegal anticipates some disruption during the protests, but he's optimistic.\n\n\"Some individuals will seek to gain attention to themselves and their cause by engaging in violence,\" he said. \"[But] even at this sort of last hour, I remain hopeful that most of the people who show up will be peaceful.\"\n\nNPR National Security Correspondent Hannah Allam and reporter Tom Bowman contributed to this report.",

        "content": "As President Trump told a sprawling crowd outside the White House that they should never accept defeat, hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in what amounted to an attempted coup that they hoped would overturn the election he lost. In the chaos, law enforcement officials said, one woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nThe violent scene — much of it incited by the president’s incendiary language — was like no other in modern American history, bringing to a sudden halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nWith poles bearing blue Trump flags, a mob that would eventually grow into the thousands bashed through Capitol doors and windows, forcing their way past police officers unprepared for the onslaught. Lawmakers were evacuated shortly before an armed standoff at the House chamber’s entrance. The woman who was shot was rushed to an ambulance, police said, and later died. Canisters of tear gas were fired across the Rotunda’s white marble floor, and on the steps outside the building, rioters flew Confederate flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“USA! USA!” chanted the would-be saboteurs of a 244-year-old democracy.\n\nThe Senate stopped its proceedings, and the House doors were closed. In a notification, U.S. Capitol Police said no one would be allowed to come or go from the building as they struggled to regain control. “Stay away from exterior windows, doors. If outside, seek cover,” police warned.\n\nAll 1,100 members of the D.C. National Guard were activated, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) imposed a citywide curfew. From 6 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday, Bowser said, no one other than essential personnel would be allowed outdoors in the city.\n\nThe mob had arrived hours earlier, charging past the metal barricades on the property’s outer edge. Hundreds, then thousands followed them. Some scaled the Capitol’s walls to reach entrances; others climbed over one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day’s end, four people would be dead: one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies that officials have yet to explain.\n\nOn the building’s east side, police initially pushed the pro-Trump demonstrators back but soon gave up and fell back to the foot of the main steps. Within a half-hour, fights broke out again, and police retreated to the top of the stairs as screaming Trump supporters surged closer. After police perimeters were breached, the elated crowd began to sing the national anthem.\n\nFor an hour, they banged on the doors, chanting, “Let us in! Let us in!” Police inside fired pepper balls and smoke bombs into the crowd but failed to turn them away. After each volley, the rioters, who were mostly White men, would cluster around the doors again, yelling, arguing, pledging revolution.\n\nSometime after 2:10 p.m., a man used a clear plastic riot shield to break through the windows on a first floor to the south side of the building, then hopped in with a few others. Once inside, police suspect, rioters opened doors to let in more of their compatriots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Capitol Police officer yelled from a higher stairway at the intruders, ordering them to stop, but when they didn’t, the officer fired at a man coming at him, two law enforcement officials said. Amid shouts and people rushing to get away from the sound of gunfire, rioters saw a woman in their group collapse. Police believe she was unarmed, a law enforcement official said, but the officer who shot her did not know that. Capitol Police had already been warned by D.C. police that many in the crowds were secretly carrying weapons.\n\n“They shot a girl!” someone yelled as a group of Trump supporters ran out of the southeast entrance.\n\nA team of paramedics with a gurney soon arrived and a Capitol Police officer stepped aside to let them pass. “White female, shot in the shoulder,” the officer said as they hurried past. They emerged minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the gurney was a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt. Dressed in jeans, the 35-year-old gazed vacantly to one side, her torso and face covered in blood. Babbitt, a California native and an Air Force veteran, was a staunch supporter of the president.\n\nAs the gurney was loaded into the back of the ambulance, pro-Trump rioters swarmed around it, screaming, “Murderers!”\n\nCapitol Police officers with long guns pushed them back, and the ambulance drove off.\n\nInside, where the lawmakers had donned gas masks kept under their chairs, Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) could only think of his family as he and other lawmakers hid from the mob. Reeling from the loss of his 25-year-old son last week, Raskin had taken one of his daughters and his son-in-law to the Capitol to watch the debates unfold over certification of Biden’s election, he said, “because we wanted to be together.” Raskin was helping lead Democrats’ arguments against Republican objectors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I thought I could show them the peaceful transfer of power in the United States of America,” Raskin told C-SPAN earlier. “What was really going through my mind was their safety because they were not with me in the chamber, and I just wanted us all to get back together.”\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said members were told that chemical irritants had been released in Statuary Hall and, for a moment, braced for the possibility that they would be exposed to tear gas. Capitol Police barricaded the doors with tables and bookshelves.\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA case officer, said that it was a crisis she would only expect to see unfold in fragile, faraway places.\n\n“This is what we see in failing countries,” she said. “This is what leads to a death of democracy.”\n\nThe shooting and the breach triggered an instant call for help across Washington to other law enforcement agencies. At the U.S. Secret Service, headquarters sent out an emergency alert to all gun-carrying Secret Service personnel to report to headquarters in preparation to help secure the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other rioters streamed into the building, where they smashed windows and vandalized offices amid furious clashes with officers desperate to maintain control.\n\n“MURDER THE MEDIA,” read a message written on one door.\n\n“WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN,” read another left in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also refused to back down, later directing her colleagues to return and finish validating Biden’s victory.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, shared a photo on Twitter of a long-haired man in a Trump hat carrying a rostrum adorned with the gold-colored seal of the speaker.\n\n“Arrest this man,” she demanded.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., more law enforcement in riot gear arrived at the Capitol.\n\n“Traitors,” Trump supporters shouted. “What’s your oath?”\n\nBiden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault” on American democracy, “unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos,” he said. “It borders on sedition, and it must end now.”\n\nFor hours, Trump made little effort to quell the violence he had helped instigate, finally sharing a video at 4:17 p.m. in which he told people to “go home” — while continuing to promote the falsehood that he had won the election.\n\n“We love you,” he told them. “You’re very special.”\n\nThe Capitol has been the target of violence before. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from a House gallery, injuring five lawmakers on the floor below. In 1971, a bomb planted by a radical left-wing group exploded, though no one was harmed. In 1998, a gunman opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. But not since the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814 has a mob overrun the ultimate symbol of American freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fallout on Wednesday was immediate, stunning the world, the country and, perhaps most of all, political Washington. Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) in denouncing Trump for provoking the mob, while Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all temporarily banned him from their platforms. Several conservative lawmakers who had planned to object to Biden’s certification announced that they had changed their minds.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m., just an hour or so after hundreds of law enforcement officers had at last finished clearing the mob and removing Trump flags left inside the building, heavily armed FBI agents and police officers in riot gear escorted lawmakers back to work.\n\nAs discussion inside the battered building resumed, the sense of fear that had gripped the nation’s capital for much of the day had yet to subside.\n\nFederal agents were investigating a pickup truck found with weapons, ammunition and potential bombmaking material parked outside the Republican National Committee, according to two people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The truck, parked across the street from the party offices and near the entrance to a Metro station, contained rifles and shotguns and a mass of ammunition, these people said. Federal agents were still trying to determine whether that vehicle and its contents are connected to suspected pipe bombs found earlier in the day.\n\nBy late evening, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said officers had arrested at least 52 people, including four for carrying pistols without a license, one for possession of a prohibited weapon and 47 for curfew violations and unlawful entry. Along with the pipe bombs, he said, police discovered a cooler packed with molotov cocktails on the Capitol grounds. In total, 14 D.C. officers were injured Wednesday. One was hospitalized after being pulled into a crowd and assaulted, and another received “significant facial injuries” after being hit with a projectile.\n\nJust past sunset, a man was stabbed at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, near Freedom Plaza, but it was unclear whether the attack was related to the assault at the Capitol, a mile east.\n\nThose who had made it inside the building took on a celebrity status when they came back out. A woman who said she had footage on her phone of Capitol Police pointing guns at rioters was circled by dozens who wanted to see it. People traded what information they had about the woman who was shot inside. Some called her a “martyr.”\n\nAfter she was taken away, the mood soured, though many remained joyous. “We’re making history,” one woman said as she strolled down Independence Avenue with friends.\n\nBeneath streaming flags, including some that read “F--- Biden” and that depicted Trump as the movie character Rambo, people loudly exhorted Jesus and chanted “USA!”\n\nMany called friends and family and took videos.\n\n“We weren’t violent before, but we are now,” a middle-aged White man said, talking into his cellphone. “There’s no going back.”",

        "content": "The U.S. Capitol was overtaken Wednesday by supporters of President Donald Trump, who, spurred on by his comments and angered by his loss, breached police lines and forced their way into the building, inside lawmakers' offices and onto the Senate floor in a bid to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThe rioting protesters sat at the desk of the Senate president, hung off balconies and milled about in tear-gas filled hallways. Lawmakers crouched and cowered in the House gallery as the mob attempted to break inside. Trump and Confederate flags flew outside and were waved inside the Capitol.\n\nA woman was shot inside the Capitol and later died, according to reports. It was not immediately clear who the victim was or who shot her.\n\nTrump supporters shattered glass in the halls of the Capitol, looting and destroying offices. Some forced their way into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's offices. In the House chamber, law enforcement drew their guns and pointed them at the doors to the chamber as protesters attempted to break inside.\n\nThe violent chaos started earlier Wednesday afternoon, when mobs swarmed the Capitol shortly after Congress entered into a joint session to certify President-elect Joe Biden's win.\n\nBy about 6 p.m officials said the Capitol building was \"secure,\" though it was not apparent what exactly that meant. Law enforcement appeared to successfully disperse some of the crowd, but many demonstrators remained well past the 6 p.m. curfew implemented by the District of Columbia, milling about as police stood around and gradually attempted to push them out of the area.\n\nLawmakers reconvened at 8 p.m., pledging to continue with the certification of votes.\n\nTrump Supporters Storm Capitol Building View All 44 Images\n\nThe day's events, while stunning, were perhaps not surprising. Trump has for months refused to concede the election, whipping supporters into a frenzy by claiming without a shred of evidence that there was widespread voter fraud, the election was \"stolen\" from him and that he is the rightful winner. A group of Republican lawmakers have backed those claims and planned to object to the electoral votes from three key states in a desperate and ultimately symbolic gesture that does not stand to change the outcome of the election.\n\nTrump's insistence that the election was rigged spurred the crowds of supporters to congregate Wednesday on the National Mall in a demonstration couched as a \"defense\" of American democracy. Trump spoke to the crowd, again claiming the election was rigged.\n\nLines of Capitol Police were quickly broken. The FBI and other agencies also later joined enforcement efforts, but reinforcements either did not arrive in time or were not enough to stop the crowds from breaching the Capitol.\n\nTrump remained relatively silent during the first couple hours of the siege, tweeting two tepid messages asking demonstrators to \"stay peaceful\" but not to leave the Capitol.\n\nAround 4:20 p.m., more than two hours after the unrest began and as demonstrators remained in and around the Capitol, Trump tweeted a video in which he repeatedly and again said the election was stolen. But he told demonstrators to \"go home.\"\n\nThen, roughly two hours later, Trump appeared sympathetic to the demonstrators.\n\n\"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTwitter later removed the tweets and locked the president's account in an unprecedented step for the social media giant.\n\nBiden earlier in the day delivered a televised speech declaring that democracy was \"under unprecedented assault\" and said the day's events amounted to an \"insurrection.\" He called on Trump to \"demand an end to this siege.\"\n\nLawmakers and officials also took to Twitter to denounce the mobs. Some pointed at Trump, calling for impeachment proceedings or accusing him of inciting the attack on the Capitol through his rhetoric.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah pointed to Trump as the root cause of the violence.\n\n\"What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States,\" Romney said.\n\nInternational leaders also denounced the mob's actions .",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nDespite weeks of planning between federal and local police agencies ahead of Wednesday’s Trump rally – including tracking social media – officials said that going into Wednesday they had no intelligence indicating there was a threat the US Capitol could be overrun.\n\nIt would turn out to be a catastrophic failure after an angry mob overwhelmed police and stormed into the Capitol building, ransacking lawmakers’ offices, injuring dozens of officers and stealing electronics and documents that could possibly include sensitive national security information. Five people died during the riots, including a woman shot by US Capitol Police and a police officer.\n\nDuring conference calls that included federal agencies and the city’s police ahead of the rally, federal law enforcement officials say the US Capitol Police assured counterparts they had the situation under control—they knew how to deal with large demonstrations at the Capitol, in large part because the complex was already being prepared for Inauguration Day, one of the most secure events in the city, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFederal and local officials said Thursday they did not have intelligence suggesting any violent mob was preparing to attack the Capitol, even as demonstrators were publicly saying on social media they were not planning a typical protest.\n\nDespite weeks of preparations, “obviously, what happened no one anticipated,” Michael Sherwin, acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters in a telephone press conference Thursday. “Things could have been done better.”\n\nOf course, there were reports of violence when Trump’s backers had come to town last month, and the FBI was monitoring everything from social media to the hotels where some of the rioters were staying. One sign of the preparations came in the days before the rally, when, acting on the FBI’s intelligence information, Washington’s Metropolitan Police arrested Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, after he left the airport en route to his hotel.\n\nHe was charged for his role in destroying a Black Lives Matter banner at a previous Proud Boys march in Washington, and prosecutors later added charges for carrying two extended ammunition magazines that are illegal in the city. As part of his release, a local judge told him to leave town and to stay away from Wednesday’s rally.\n\nPolice were caught flat-footed the next day. DC Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Thursday there was no intelligence that suggested there would be a breach of the US Capitol on January 6. Three DHS sources, who usually receive such reports, were unaware of a threat assessment being shared from the DHS intelligence office ahead of Wednesday’s siege.\n\nSeveral federal executive branch agencies had teams on standby ready to assist Capitol Police. And they weren’t aware the Capitol Police weren’t in any position to be able to prevent the insurrection at the Capitol that led to some of the most secure areas of the building to be overrun by rioters.\n\nThe call for help from the Capitol Police came as protesters, apparently riled up from speeches during a rally near the White House, began converging at barricades outside the Capitol. It was too late.\n\nSerious questions about being caught off guard\n\nThe ransacking of the Capitol has sparked serious questions across Washington about how the US Capitol was caught so off guard – putting in danger lawmakers as well as Vice President Mike Pence – and why law enforcement treated President Donald Trump’s supporters differently than the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred last year. The episode has quickly led to recriminations on Capitol Hill – with Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund planning to resign next week – and vows to investigate the incident from Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant at Arms, Michael Stenger, submitted his resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nPart of the planning for the Trump rally took into account criticism that federal and local police, and the US National Guard received for handling of summer protests, federal and local officials say.\n\nThis included a heavy-handed response to protesters near Lafayette Park, who were cleared to make way for a Trump photo op walk to St. John’s Church across from the White House. The visible police and National Guard presence for the Trump rally was notably less aggressive than during summer protests.\n\nA Homeland Security law enforcement source said the “most glaring and obvious speck in our eye is when you contrast it to similar demonstrations that did not always go well and the response,” referring to the heavy-handed response DHS had in Portland and Washington, DC this past summer.\n\nCoordinated by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, federal executive branch agencies had more than 500 officers and agents close by and ready to help, a Justice Department spokesman said.\n\n“We had what I believe were sufficient federal resources for this,” Sherwin said, adding, “I cannot speak for the Capitol Police.”\n\nSund issued a statement Thursday saying that Capitol Police “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.”\n\n“But make no mistake – these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior,” Sund said, adding that the rioters “actively” attacked officers and were “determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage.”\n\nBut police chiefs across the country who plan for major protests, sometimes with other agencies, make contingency plans for how to respond when something goes wrong – for when a First Amendment protest turns into violence, which Wednesday’s rioters said all along it would be.\n\nOne of the complications of the capital is that the Capitol Police reports to Congress and is separate from the Executive Branch agencies, including the FBI and Secret Service, which don’t have jurisdiction on the Capitol grounds unless requested by the Capitol Police.\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Terrance Gainer told CNN that Washington, DC, police have responsibility for the entire city, while Capitol police cover the area that includes the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings.\n\n“What’s kind of been worked out is, everyone tends to their business until we need each other,” Gainer said. “There’s some concurrent jurisdictions, some separate.”\n\nIn practice, the different agencies do their own work until they’re needed. There was a time when Metro Police couldn’t give field sobriety tests so Capitol Police would respond to DUI traffic stops, Gainer said.\n\nCall for help came too late\n\nSherwin said the first indication of trouble was when crowds began breaching entrances on the east front of the Capitol building.\n\nFederal officials had been asked for help – first with bomb threats in multiple locations, and then to the Capitol itself – but they said by the time they were asked to respond to the chaos at the Capitol, it was too late for them to intervene and stop the building from being breached.\n\n“They have jurisdiction. And the minute they asked for support, we sent it,” Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said on Fox News. “And by the way, they asked for support before violence began. So that was not a pure reaction. There was some planning to it. But it was just too close to when everything began to heat up. And they were outnumbered and overwhelmed. I mean, that’s why you see pictures like that. It’s pure, it’s just numbers.”\n\nMultiple federal law enforcement agencies deployed emergency response teams near the Capitol on Wednesday that were eventually deployed to respond to the unfolding rioters that had breached the Capitol building.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department, DC’s local police force, said there was a call for help from Capitol Police at 1 p.m. Both the FBI and the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau had teams near the Capitol, and after they received a call for help, more than 300 agents and officers were deployed to the Capitol, sources told CNN.\n\nBut less than 90 minutes later, the Capitol was under siege as rioters entered into some of the most secure parts of the building, including the Senate chamber and Pelosi’s office.\n\nThe Homeland Security law enforcement official said both ICE and CBP had quick response teams available if needed for any protests or breach of headquarters locations. Those teams were on standby, the official said, but there was no request for DHS assets to go to the Capitol beyond a limited number of Secret Service and Federal Protection Service officers.\n\nThe FBI response included SWAT teams and other special agents who were deployed to assist US Capitol Police to clear the Capitol grounds, as well as a Hostage Rescue Team. The FBI also has evidence response teams on site collecting evidence and bomb technicians to respond to pipe bombs at buildings that house the Republican and Democratic National Committees.\n\nA team of The ATF’s explosive specialists responded to bomb threats in Washington, DC. A short time later, they received the call for help from Capitol Police and ATF’s special response team and agents from Baltimore and Washington deployed to the Capitol to assist clearing the rioters.\n\nCongressional leaders quickly got on the phone with acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy in the early moments of the riots, while lawmakers were being evacuated from the House and Senate chambers, Schumer said Thursday. The call was tense, a source said, with lawmakers demanding answers about why there wasn’t better protection.\n\n“The question is why weren’t they there in advance, and then why didn’t they get there ASAP. All of that needs to looking into,” Schumer told reporters.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan Thursday said that he was on the phone with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who pleaded with him to send the Maryland National Guard to help. But Hogan said the Maryland Guard was told multiple times “we don’t have authorization” and waited an hour and a half before he finally received a call from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy to the Capitol.\n\nHogan said that McCarthy asked him, “‘Can you come as soon as possible?’ Yeah, we’ve been waiting. We’re ready.”\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that it was Pence, not Trump, who helped to facilitate members of the DC National Guard deploying to the Capitol, and Trump initially resisted deploying the National Guard.\n\nClearing the Capitol\n\nAfter lawmakers, aides and reporters had been evacuated to safety, it was the FBI and ATF teams that ultimately cleared the Capitol building, and not Capitol police, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe two agencies each went from one end of the Capitol, room-to-room, meeting in the middle to clear the building and allow Congress to return to the House and Senate chambers to finish certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win, sources said.\n\nAround 7 p.m., as the Capitol complex was being cleared, federal law enforcement agencies held another call with Pence and House and Senate leaders. Capitol Police were not included in the call, according to one source, and the tone was quite different than the earlier call as the situation was still unfolding.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was up late into the night in Qatar monitoring events as they unfolded on Capitol Hill Wednesday, according to a DHS official familiar with his trip. In light of the siege on the Capitol, Wolf arranged to return to the US as quickly as possible, the official said, following visits to Cyprus, Bahrain and Qatar this week.\n\nICE Homeland Security Investigations personnel, who were deployed to support Federal Protective Service last year to protect the agency’s buildings amid protests, were not sent out to the Capitol Wednesday, and stayed at ICE headquarters as they did during the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, though they were on standby to assist, according to two officials. Federal Protective Service, meanwhile, requested assistance from US Customs and Border Protection to protect federal facilities and property.\n\n“There are many questions lingering about the attack on the US Capitol and it will take time to discover the answers,” said FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor in an internal message to the workforce Thursday, which was obtained by CNN. FEMA staff, Gaynor said, worked overnight to “support efforts to ensure continuity of government operations.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect a Capitol Hill police officer has died.",

Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said.\n\nProtesters were also seen inside the Senate chamber. One got up on the dais and yelled “Trump won that election.”\n\nSeveral dozen are roaming through the halls, yelling “Where are they?” according to a pool report.\n\nCongressional leaders were whisked to safety. Vice-President Elect Kamala Harris, who was attending the joint session, and was also said to be safe.\n\nAt an earlier rally, Trump had urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. After protesters clashed with law enforcement and breached the Capitol building, Trump tweeted to his supporters to “stay peaceful.”\n\n“Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement,” Trump tweeted, as tear gas was deployed in the locked-down Capitol. “They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\n“We’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them,” Trump said.\n\nBoth chambers abruptly went into recess. The District of Columbia's Mayor, Muriel Bowser, issued a curfew for 6 p.m.\n\nThe skirmishes occurred outside in the very spot where president-elect Biden will be inaugurated in just two weeks.\n\nProtesters tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’s steps and were met by officers in riot gear. Some tried to push past the officers who held shields and officers could be seen firing pepper spray into the crowd to keep them back. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back.\n\nA suspicious package was also reported in the area, Capitol Police said.\n\nThe skirmishes came just shortly after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters, riling up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally near the White House on Wednesday ahead of Congress' vote.\n\n“We will not let them silence your voices,” Trump told the protesters, who had lined up before sunrise to get a prime position to hear the president.",

        "content": "Right-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦",

The shooting shocked many in Japan, which is one of the world's safest nations and has some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere.\n\n\"It is barbaric and malicious and it cannot be tolerated,\" current Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the media.\n\nPolice say Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, fired two shots at Abe as he was making a political speech in the city of Nara. The first shot missed, but the second hit Abe's chest and neck, and despite attempts to revive him he died several hours later.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYamagami was unemployed and a former member of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force for three years, police say, and attacked Abe because he believed he was associated with a group Yamagami hated. Multiple handmade guns were later found at Yamagami's home.\n\nAbe, 67, served as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, and again from 2012 to 2020, when he suddenly resigned citing health issues. Despite leaving office, he remained influential within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and continued to be a force on Japan's political landscape.\n\nTributes poured in from around the world\n\nIn a statement, President Biden said he was \"stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened\" by the assassination, calling Abe his friend. \"His vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure.\"\n\nPresident Biden later said he plans to stop at the Japanese embassy in Washington on Friday afternoon to sign a book of condolences.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in Asia for a meeting of Group of 20 foreign ministers, called the assassination \"profoundly disturbing\" and described Abe as a leader of great vision.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Abe as \"a towering global statesman, an outstanding leader, and a remarkable administrator.\" He said on Twitter that July 9 would be a day of national mourning in India.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin described Abe as an \"outstanding statesman,\" and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott described him simply as Japan's \"most significant post-war leader.\"\n\nAbe made broad economic strides but failed at goal of revising Japan's constitution\n\nAs prime minister, Abe worked to build up Japan's military, counter China's growing clout and sought to boost and reform the economy though a program that came to be known as \"Abenomics.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, Abe reformed immigration policy, female labor-force participation climbed, and the Japanese economy unexpectedly returned to healthy growth.\n\nMichael Green, a former national security council staff member in the George W. Bush administration who worked with Abe extensively, said Abe was the most consequential leader modern Japan has seen. His vision for putting Japan back on the map geopolitically inspired loyalty across the country's bureaucracy and elected officials.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I think his legacy is profound,\" Green told Morning Edition. \"There is no major political figure in Japan arguing for a different direction, other than tactical changes, from what Abe put in place when he was prime minister.\"\n\nAt times in recent years when the U.S. seemed unsure of its footing in the region, Green said Abe held things together.\n\n\"When president Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this major trade pact in Asia, Abe stepped in and kept it going and urged the U.S. to return,\" he said. \"When the Trump administration was fighting with Europe at the G7 summits, Abe was the peacemaker. ... He really stepped up to reinforce the international order, the liberal order that America helped to build, as China and Russia asserted themselves.\"\n\nHe ultimately failed to achieve his most cherished political goal, and that of his party: to revise Japan's pacifist, post-World War II constitution. Abe proposed revisions would strengthen the government's emergency powers, while downplaying the role of human rights. Abe felt the political values imposed by the U.S.-backed constitution were alien to some of Japan's traditions, such as reverence for the emperor.\n\nAbe was, however, successful in passing legislation in 2015 that allows Japan's military to expand its operations overseas in support of allies, including the United States.\n\nAbe grew increasingly critical of China\n\nWhen he left office, most Japanese were dissatisfied with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, feeling he moved too slowly to impose a state of emergency mostly out of concerns about the economy.\n\nIn recent months, Abe had been a more outspoken critic of China. Earlier this year, he called on the United States to drop its long-standing practice of \"strategic ambiguity\" and give Taiwan assurances that it could count on American help in the event of an attack by China.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe also angered China by saying \"a Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency,\" and noting that it would be impossible for Japan not to be sucked into a conflict over the self-governed island that Beijing considers a part of China.\n\nNPR's Jackie Northam and Christopher Dean Hopkins contributed to this report.",

        "content": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nShinzo Abe was a political blueblood groomed for power. Japan's longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history.\n\nAbe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past.\n\nAt the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons.\n\n“He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ... He also wanted Japan to not have to keep apologizing for World War II.”\n\nAbe, who died after being shot during a campaign speech, was 67.\n\nPolice arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the attack, which shocked many in Japan, one of the world’s safest nations with some of the strictest gun control laws. Near the suspect was a double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun.\n\nAbe believed that Japan's postwar track record of economic success, peace and global cooperation was something \"other countries should pay more attention to, and that Japanese should be proud of,” Leheny said.\n\nAbe was a darling of conservatives but reviled by many liberals in Japan. And no policy was more divisive than his cherished, ultimately unsuccessful dream to revise Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. His ultra-nationalism also angered the Koreas and China, both wartime victims of Japan.\n\nAssassination caught on camera\n\nAbe was in Nara campaigning ahead of Sunday’s election for Japan's upper house and was giving a speech when he was shot.\n\nIn eyewitness video from the scene, which was widely shared on social media, two shots can be clearly heard. Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired footage showing Abe collapsing on the street, with several security guards running toward him. He was bleeding and holding his chest.\n\nTwitter, Facebook parent Meta and other social media companies scrambled Friday to police videos on their platforms of the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that break rules on harmful content.\n\nMultiple videos of the attack by a gunman who fired a homemade, double-barreled weapon twice at Abe circulated on social media. Some only show the moments before and after the attack while others showed both shots.\n\nTwitter said its enforcement teams were working to “address harmful content” relating to the attack by “proactively removing” material that violates its rules, which include restrictions on sensitive media including graphic violence.\n\nTwitter urged users to flag up any potentially sensitive material of the attack so it can take action. Videos of the attack could still be found easily on Twitter many hours after the attack.\n\nMeta said it was deleting videos depicting the moment of the attack and had disabled the suspect’s Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nHow has Europe reacted?",

        "content": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nTo many in Asia-Pacific, Shinzo Abe was prescient in recognizing the challenge a rising China posed to the American-led system of political and military alliances.\n\nAnd the former Japanese Prime Minister – killed by an assassin’s bullet on July 8 – arguably did more than any of his Western contemporaries to meet that challenge.\n\nAbe, who served two separate terms and was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, will be remembered by many as the leader who finally led the country out of the shadows of World War II.\n\nHe foresaw that the rapid growth of China’s People’s Liberation Army – fueled by one of the world’s fastest growing economies – would upset the regional balance of power, and argued Japan would, as a result of this shift, have to rethink its post-war, US-imposed pacifist constitution.\n\nIn 2014, Abe’s government reinterpreted that constitution to enable the Japanese military to theoretically fight overseas. And he gave it the tools to do so, buying stealth fighters and building Japan’s first aircraft carriers since World War II to accommodate them.\n\nBut perhaps his biggest contribution to the defense of his country – and to many, the security of the wider Asia region – lies not in military equipment, but in language; in his coining of the simple phrase: “a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nParadigm shift\n\nWith those few words, Abe transformed the way many foreign policy leaders talk – and think – about Asia.\n\nToday, much to the annoyance of China’s leaders, that phrase is everywhere. It is used like a mantra by the US military and is the vocabulary of choice for any aspiring Western diplomat.\n\nSo it can be hard to remember that, before Abe, few people in these circles talked of the “Indo-Pacific” at all.\n\nBefore 2007, the preference in Washington was to conceptualize Asia as that great stretch of the globe spanning from Australia to China to the United States – and to refer to it as the “Asia-Pacific.”\n\nThis concept had China at its center – anathema for Abe who, like many Japanese, feared Beijing’s growing clout meant his country could be bullied by a far larger neighbor.\n\nAbe’s aim was to encourage the world to view Asia through a far wider lens – that of the “Indo-Pacific,” a concept spanning both the Indian and Pacific oceans that he first promoted in a 2007 speech to the Indian Parliament titled the “Confluence of the Two Seas.”\n\nThis rethinking of Asia’s boundaries did two things. Firstly, it shifted the geographical center to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea – conveniently focusing minds on an area of the world where Beijing has territorial disputes with a string of nations.\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, it brought into the picture the one country in the world that could act as a counterweight to China through its sheer size alone: India.\n\nJapan's helicopter carrier, the Huga, at a pier in Yokohama in 2009. Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBringing India into the fold\n\nAbe recognized “India’s importance as a democratic balancer to future Chinese hegemony” and “began systematically wooing Indian leaders to the framing,” wrote John Hemmings, of the East-West Center in Washington, in a 2020 evaluation of Abe that coincided with the end of his second stint as Prime Minister.\n\n“Including a democratic India in the future of Asia was not only good geopolitics, it was good geo-economics, as India’s population and democratic system balanced out China’s equally large population and authoritarian system.”\n\nAbe became a driving force behind the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, which brought India into a partnership with Japan, the US and Australia that launched the same year as his “Confluence of the Two Seas” speech.\n\nThe partnership has its roots in relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but it gained an “ideological component” in a 2006 campaign speech by Abe, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It was then reborn in 2007 as a strategic forum featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and –crucially – joint military drills that have met pushback from China.\n\nMonths later Abe outlined his vision of a “broader Asia … an immense network” spanning countries that share “fundamental values” such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests.\n\nThat description appeared to leave little room for China, which has felt threatened by the Quad ever since, and whose Foreign Minister Wang Yi has openly accused the US of trying to encircle China with an “Indo-Pacific NATO.”\n\nShinzo Abe meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the banks of the River Ganges at Varanasi in December 2015. Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA free and open Indo-Pacific\n\nWhen for a while it appeared China’s hostility might scupper the Quad, which fell apart in 2008 following threats of economic retaliation by Beijing, Abe played his hand once again.\n\nAccording to Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abe first outlined his vision for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” at a keynote speech in Kenya in 2016.\n\nHis vision consisted of three pillars: the promotion and establishment of the rule of law, freedom of navigation and free trade; the pursuit of economic prosperity; and a commitment to peace and stability.\n\nThe term acted “as a foil for Beijing’s increasingly China-centric vision of Asia’s future, while promoting openness and values to attract regional hedgers,” said Hemmings, of the East-West Center.\n\nThe year after Abe’s Kenya speech, the Quad was reborn – and the Trump administration unveiled its own concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nBy the time of Abe’s death the Quad had expanded significantly. In the past two years the four countries have held two joint naval exercises, convened around the mantra of promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nAbe’s legacy\n\nWriting after Abe’s death, Robert Ward, Japan chair of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted how Abe had restructured his country’s foreign policy, “driven by his quick recognition of the threat to Japan and the regional order from China’s rapid rise.”\n\nAs such, Ward wrote, it was “hard to overstate the transformational importance of his legacy, both inside and outside Japan.”\n\nThe breadth of Abe’s influence is clear from the tributes that followed his death.\n\nAmong the statesmen paying their respects was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – who has referred to Abe as a “dear friend” since meeting him in 2007, and declared last Saturday a day of national mourning in India for the former Japanese leader.\n\nTelling, too, were the tributes from the US – China’s biggest rival and Japan’s biggest military ally.\n\nUnder Abe, ties between the US and Japan had reached a “new level,” said Tobias Harris, senior fellow for Asia at the Center for American Progress, and this was reflected in President Joe Biden’s order that US flags be flown at half-staff at all public buildings in the country and all federal facilities around the world.\n\nIt was also reflected in the White House’s official tribute. Abe was “a faithful friend to the United States,” the White House said. “He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nJoe Biden meets Shinzo Abe in New York City in 2014. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nWords of remembrance\n\nThere’s that line again, “a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nThe phrase has become ubiquitous in US policy and military statements, while in 2018 the Pentagon’s Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii changed its name to Indo-Pacific Command to recognize “the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific oceans as America focuses West.”\n\nIn a speech titled “A Free and Open Indo-Pacific” in Indonesia last December, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would “work with our allies and partners to defend the rules-based order that we’ve built together over decades to ensure the region remains open and accessible.”\n\nThen at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used the term “rules-based order” or variants eight times.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida used the term 19 times as he explained Japan’s promotion of “a free and open Indo-Pacific” vision that had “come to gain broad support in the international community.”\n\nThat “broad support” may be Abe’s most enduring legacy. A tribute, in its own way, to the vision Abe had hinted at eight years earlier in his own speech to the Shangri La Dialogue.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken gives a speech titled \"A Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, in December 2021. Oliver Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTelling his audience Tokyo was ready to take the lead in making the region prosperous for all, Abe had called on all countries to observe international law so that future generations could “share in this bounty.”\n\n“If you imagine how vast the Pacific and Indian Oceans are, our potential is exactly like the oceans,” Abe said. “Limitless, isn’t it?”",

In the world of conservative Japanese politics, he was the bluest of blue bloods, a true princeling as the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, who had served as a powerful prime minister early in the post-World War II era. But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nAlready, as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the early 2000s when I first observed him, Abe had an aura of dynamism, self-confidence, and ambition. In the world of conservative Japanese politics, he was the bluest of blue bloods, a true princeling as the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, who had served as a powerful prime minister early in the post-World War II era. But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nI could sense this in the self-assured way that he handled briefings for journalists when he spoke extemporaneously and with muscular language. And I saw it even closer at hand in the way he handled arrangements for a rare summit in 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, between his boss at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.\n\nAbe personally took charge of some of the stickiest issues in this diplomacy, such as Japan’s quest to learn of the fate of Japanese citizens who had been allegedly abducted by North Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s as well as to recover the remains of those abductees who had died there. In Abe’s position as deputy chief cabinet secretary, many other politicians would have taken care to avoid the spotlight. But for Abe, who seemed to relish having the cameras on him, the challenge was avoiding getting too much attention.\n\nAbe was one of the first world leaders I covered who was roughly my own age. In 2006, his ambitions would be realized when he became the youngest prime minister in postwar Japan at age 52. His first stint in that office ended like that of most of his predecessors though, with a brief tenure that ended just a year later due to health problems. It is a mark of his remarkable drive that five years later, in 2012, he would return to office and end his career in 2020 as the longest-serving prime minister in the country’s history.\n\nHere, already, we can see hints of the many deep contradictions that this rare politician, brought down by a lone gunman, would come to embody. Abe’s dream was to modernize Japan—and to do so by modernizing his country’s politics. Operationally though, he always had a more fundamental—even inescapable—priority: to strengthen the position of the long dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that he led. Few truisms have been more accurate than the old saw that the LDP is neither liberal nor democratic.\n\nAbe succeeded in maintaining and arguably even strengthening his party’s near-stranglehold on power, but the LDP has never been keen on bold reform—and in some regards, this was true of Abe himself. Take, for example, his pledge to implement what he called “womenomics,” by which he meant making Japan “a place where women shine.” Despite the economic demographic urgency of welcoming women into the workplace as equals in pay and status, and even into the country’s defense forces, progress in this regard has been halting, and prominent LDP politicians frequently lapse into vulgar sexism in their public language.\n\nAbe liked the suffix “-nomics” and was even more deeply associated with a set of policies aimed at the competitive reinvigoration of his country, widely known as “Abenomics.” It is true that during his long tenure, the stock market leaped after a long period of stagnation, but economic inequality also widened substantially during his time in office. The jury is also out on the degree to which he succeeded in positioning Japan to compete with industrially dynamic neighbors, such as South Korea and especially China.\n\nIn purely political terms, Abe’s long second tenure in office seemed like it might mark a break with the endless cast of ephemeral LDP leaders who shuffled into and then promptly out of the prime minister’s office. But Abe’s immediate, handpicked successor, the rhetorically clumsy and faceless Yoshihide Suga, only held office from September 2020 until the following September. Abe clearly hoped to temper the effects of this chronic short termism at the top in Japanese politics by cultivating maximal influence as a godfather and éminence grise with at least one foot always prominently on stage, as his was during his deputyship under Koizumi. But with his death, that dream, too, is gone.\n\nIn foreign relations, Abe was the most active and dynamic Japanese political figure at least since Yasuhiro Nakasone, who spent five years as prime minister in the 1980s and struck up a close working relationship with, among other world leaders, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. For Abe’s part, he was quick to jump into his airplane and tireless in his personal diplomacy. This meant becoming the first foreign leader to visit with a then-newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York and having more in-person encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin than with any other world leader.\n\nAnd through sheer persistence, it meant overcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ostentatious disdain for Abe: The two finally met for the first time at a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in Beijing in 2014. The photograph of this first meeting is a classic and can be read in many ways. To me, despite his look of exhaustion, Abe seems to have a twinkle of satisfaction that he finally obtained a mano a mano with the powerful leader of the giant next door, whereas Xi’s face looks almost sheepish, as if he was thinking, “I can’t believe I’ve been brought to shake hands with this guy.”\n\nAbe and Xi stand side by side facing forward toward the camera while shaking hands.\n\nIn the end though, what did Abe’s force of persistence and personality win for Japan?\n\nMany in the U.S. foreign relations and national security worlds rushed forward to lionize Abe after his death. They celebrated his persistent efforts to strengthen the defense alliance with the United States, to become a much more active and muscular presence in the Asia Pacific region, to revise the Japanese Constitution (written by Americans during the postwar occupation of Japan), and above all—and related to each of these items—to help the United States by serving more directly as a bulwark to a rising China.\n\nBut here, even more than in other areas of Abe’s legacy, the contradictions abound. Arguably, the best thing Japan could do to improve its security would be to engineer with persistence and discipline a deep rapprochement with South Korea. Yet Abe’s family history—particularly as the grandson of Kishi, who barely escaped being judged as a war criminal—seemed to render this impossible for him.\n\nHis dream was instead to create what he called “forward-looking” relations with Korea and an unapologetic attitude toward his country’s past. That meant never abandoning the hope that he and future Japanese leaders could pray at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto abode for the spirits of the country’s war dead, explicitly including those condemned as criminals for their role in Japan’s imperial wars of the 20th century.\n\nEven as he pushed for closer ties with the United States, meanwhile, Abe clung to his belief in the noble intentions behind and even legitimacy of Japanese conquest—and therefore, the illegitimacy of the postwar trials and, by implication, the U.S. occupation and the Japanese Constitution written by the Americans, which forever forbids Japan from possessing an army that can pursue offensive war aims. But the same Japanese public that kept Abe in office for so long never followed him all the way down that road. Abe died still pushing for a revision of the so-called peace constitution, and in this regard, he died a frustrated man.\n\nIt will be for future generations of Japanese to decide just how far to go in recommitting toward an alliance with the United States. Whatever happens, China will always be Japan’s much larger—and for the foreseeable future, more economically and militarily powerful—neighbor. Japan trades more with China than with the United States, and in the case of conflict, it would be devastated by a Western-imposed sanctions regime on China along the lines of U.S.- and European-led efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. A U.S. shooting war with China would present Japan with even more terrifying choices. Is its alliance with Washington worth having Chinese missiles rain down on Japanese territory or sink Japanese vessels at sea?\n\nWe must all hope that things never come to this, but hope is not a strategy. There is a case to be made, as I argued in my 2017 book, Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power, that the period of maximal risk of war in East Asia spans the next couple of decades. After then, profound demographic change in China will cause Beijing to devote more and more of its wealth to retirement and social welfare payments at home and to pull back on its ambitions in the near and far overseas.\n\nUnder such a scenario, Abe’s vision for Japan becomes only one of several competing logics. Coming more fully to terms with its past and drawing closer to its neighbors—which is not to say turning away from the United States—seems like an equally obvious alternative possibility.",

        "content": "Mourners at the site where former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot in Nara, Japan, on Friday.\n\nThe assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a campaign rally in western Japan was especially hard to fathom because it involved a gun — a type of crime that is extremely rare in a country with some of the most stringent laws on buying and owning firearms.\n\nGun violence is almost unheard-of in Japan. There was only one firearm-related death in all of 2021. Since 2017, there have been 14 gun-related deaths, a remarkably low figure for a country of 125 million people.\n\nExpressing a common reaction, Erika Inoue, a 25-year-old designer in Tokyo, said the gun violence was hard to process.\n\n“The shooting part is confusing,” she said. “There are guns? In Japan?”\n\nJapan’s firearms law states that, in principle, guns are not permitted in the country. There are exceptions for guns used in hunting, but the process of getting a license is time-consuming and expensive, so very few people go through the hassle.\n\nA person must pass 12 steps before purchasing a firearm, starting with a gun-safety class and then passing a written exam administered three times a year. A doctor must sign off on the gun buyer’s physical and mental health. Other steps include an extensive background check and a police inspection of the gun safe and ammunition locker required for storing firearms and bullets.\n\nImage A security officer apprehending the suspect in the shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.

The Asahi Shimbun, via Getty Images\n\nThe shooting was all the more shocking because before Friday, even the idea of a political murder seemed like a relic of a long-gone era.\n\nTempers rarely run high in Japan’s famously sedate politics. Parliamentary debates usually don’t move beyond cat calls and faux outrage and even the ultra-right-wing groups that regularly prowl city streets in black vans, blaring political propaganda, are viewed as more of a nuisance than a threat to public safety.\n\nPolice protection at political events is light, and during campaign season, voters have plenty of opportunities to interact with the country’s top leaders. Videos showed Friday’s suspected shooter walking unobstructed in proximity of the former prime minister and firing a handmade gun.\n\nLocal Japanese police said the handmade gun used in the shooting was more than a foot long and eight inches in height. They also said they seized several handmade guns in a search of the suspect’s home.\n\nUnlike the United States, where gun rights are a constant topic of debate, firearms are rarely discussed in Japanese political circles. Mass killings — in the rare instances when they occur — usually do not involve guns. Instead, perpetrators resort to arson or stabbings.\n\nIn recent weeks, Japanese media watched the spate of mass shootings in the United States with a mix of disbelief and confusion. After the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, The Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s second-largest newspaper by circulation, published an editorial calling the United States “a gun society” and said that another tragedy had turned a classroom into a “gun massacre zone.”\n\nImage Police investigating the site where a knife-wielding man killed a police officer, then used the officer’s gun to fatally shoot a security guard, in Toyama prefecture in 2018. Credit... Jiji Press/via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nToyo Keizai, a prominent weekly business magazine and website, published an article last year after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol asking: “Why is ‘Gun Ownership’ a Non-Negotiable Right in the U.S.?”\n\n“It is difficult for Japanese to understand why gun ownership continues in the U.S. even with such a high number of victims,” journalist Keiko Tsuyama said in the article.\n\nMost Japanese people almost never encounter guns in day-to-day life even though police officers carry firearms. And until Mr. Abe’s shooting, Japan had almost no experience with the emotional and political aftermath of gun violence — something that has become a familiar ritual in the United States.\n\nIn 2021, there were 10 shootings in Japan that contributed to death, injury or property damage, according to the National Police Agency. Of those gun-related episodes, one person was killed and four others were injured. The figures do not include accidents or suicides.\n\nMost of the roughly 192,000 licensed firearms in the country are shotguns and hunting rifles. By comparison, in the United States, where most firearms are not registered, the number of guns in civilian hands is by some estimates close to 400 million.\n\nPolitical assassinations were a regular feature of Japan’s turbulent politics in the years leading up to World War II. But since then, only a handful of politicians have been murdered — and most without the use of guns.\n\nThe last killing of a national-level political figure was in 1960, when a 17-year-old extreme nationalist stabbed to death the leader of Japan’s Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma.\n\nImage The last assassination of a national political figure in Japan: A 17-year-old used a sword to kill Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Socialist Party, on a Tokyo stage in 1960.

Yasushi Nagao/The Mainichi Shimbun/Bettmann/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThat same year, another ultranationalist attacked Mr. Abe’s grandfather, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, stabbing him repeatedly in the leg and sending him to the hospital.\n\nIn recent decades, what little political violence Japan has seen has often been linked to organized crime or to right-wing groups. In 2007, Kazunaga Ito, the mayor of Nagasaki, was shot to death by a gang member.\n\nJournalists have also occasionally been targets. In 1987, a reporter for the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun was murdered, in an incident linked to right-wing anti-Korean groups.\n\nProtesters have sometimes expressed their grievances by taking their own lives, hoping to draw public sympathy to their causes. Most famously, the novelist Yukio Mishima killed himself by disembowelment in 1970, after leading a small group of right-wing militants in a failed coup.\n\nGerald L. Curtis, a professor emeritus of political science and expert in Japanese politics at Columbia University, said that the deadly attack on Mr. Abe would reverberate through Japan’s politics.\n\n“It no doubt will shake up the Japanese terribly and will reinforce the view that Japan is no longer the safe, peaceful country it has been since the end of World War II and has to change to deal with the new frightening realities it faces,” he said in an email.\n\n“The question is how Japan’s political leaders respond.”",

        "content": "The murder on 8 July 2022 of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe while campaigning for upcoming elections in the historic city of Nara, shocks both Japan and the world at large. Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations",

        "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\n(JTA) — Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan who boosted relations with Israel as part of his effort to increase his country’s global influence, was assassinated at a campaign rally on Friday.\n\nAbe, 67, who led Japan from 2012 to 2020 after a short stint in 2006-2007, was speaking at a rally in Nara when he was shot multiple times from behind. Japan has some of the strictest gun policies in the world, and one of the lowest gun violence rates; the alleged shooter’s gun looked to have been homemade, NPR reported.\n\nAbe was a staunch nationalist who sought to dramatically change Japan’s pacifist postwar character, increasing military spending and becoming more engaged with several world powers. His multi-faceted plans for sweeping economic reforms earned its own internationally known nickname: “Abenomics.”\n\nIncreased diplomacy with Israel was a prime example of Japan’s foreign policy shift during Abe’s consequential second tenure as prime minister. Due to its close ties with oil-producing Arab countries that were historically hostile to Israel, Japan had for decades been wary to establish warm relations with Jerusalem.\n\nBut by 2014, after a visit to Tokyo by then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a leader who shared many of his Japanese counterpart’s right-wing characteristics, trade between the two countries had risen by nearly 10%. Beyond economics, the two leaders signed historic pacts to bolster tourism and security cooperation. Israel’s military expertise made the country a particularly attractive partner for Abe, a historian told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2015.\n\n“I am determined, together with Prime Minister Netanyahu, to make further efforts to strengthen Japan-Israel relations, so that the potentials are fully materialized,” Abe said at the time.\n\nAbe returned the favor by offering in 2017 to host a four-way peace summit among Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials and then visiting Jerusalem in 2018. Things were going smoothly until the meal at Netanyahu’s residence ended with dessert served in a shoe — a major faux pas that made international headlines. In Japanese culture, shoes are kept outside of office and work spaces, a well-known taboo.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail",

        "content": "Elon Musk has only been in charge of Twitter since late October. But already, he’s turned the company and its platform upside down.\n\nAmid all the chaos, it’s unclear how long Musk will even stay on as CEO of the social media company. On December 20, Musk confirmed that he will step down as chief executive of Twitter as soon as he finds a replacement, and will eventually run its “software & servers” teams. His announcement came less than two days after he ran a Twitter poll asking people if he should step down, and a clear majority voted in favor of him leaving.\n\nMusk would be leaving Twitter a more precarious company than he found it. In the past two months, Musk has gutted Twitter’s staff, reportedly including some key engineering functions, causing concerns about the site’s technical ability to stay up and running. Twitter’s advertisers, meanwhile are reportedly fleeing the platform because they’re concerned about the resurgence of hate speech under Musk’s “free speech absolutist” policies.\n\nAnd his new check mark system — Musk’s first major product update — caused chaos in the hours after its release, as newly checkmarked users flooded the app with fake accounts, impersonating figures from Nintendo’s Mario character to former US President George W. Bush.\n\nWhile Musk didn’t immediately change any of Twitter’s policies against offensive content, in the hours after Musk took over there was a notable surge in hate speech on the app. Some of the users posting felt emboldened by Musk’s “free speech absolutist” attitude, and actively tried to test the limits of what they could say on Twitter under the company’s new leadership. Others have tested the limits of Musk’s free speech stance by making fun of him personally.\n\nBut it’s not all fun and games. Many current and former employees, social media academics, and human rights advocates are concerned that Musk could change Twitter for the worse, turning it into an even more intense cesspool of negative content than it already is. Sparking further concern, Musk has suspended several accounts of prominent journalists over highly debatable claims that they “doxxed” the billionaire, which many critics saw as another sign that Musk is censoring speech he personally disagrees with. But others hope Musk can breathe new life into a platform that was already bleeding its most prolific users and, for years, has struggled to turn a profit. In a staff meeting on November 10, Musk said bankruptcy was not out of the question if Twitter doesn’t figure out a way to make more money.\n\nHere are some of the most significant ways Musk has changed the company so far.\n\nDo you currently or formerly work at Twitter and want to talk about the current situation at the company?

We can protect your anonymity.\n\nCreating uncertainty about who will run the company\n\nOn December 18, Musk ran a poll asking if he should step down from Twitter, inviting people to vote “yes” or “no.” The results were clear: 57 percent of some 17 million respondents voted “yes.”\n\nWhat’s less clear is who Musk would pick as his replacement. It’s anyone’s guess. Some floated Jared Kushner, since Musk was pictured spending time with him at the World Cup in Qatar around the time he made the poll. But Musk seems to think he’s the only one who can run Twitter, tweeting a reply on Thursday, “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.”\n\nAnd even if Musk were to step down from his day-to-day duties as CEO, he would still retain control as the the owner of the company. So while Musk has created a lot of chaos about Twitter’s leadership, he’ll still ultimately be the one in charge — unless he sells the company or makes it go bankrupt.\n\nReinstating suspended accounts\n\nFrom the beginning, Musk took over Twitter with the stated goal of making it a platform that allowed more controversial speech.\n\nA little under a month after he took over the company, Musk reinstated the account of former President Donald Trump, who was previously banned from Twitter following the the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol. The move was highly controversial, although Trump has yet to post any new tweets, saying he prefers his own social media app, Truth Social.\n\nMusk went even further in late November. He ran another poll asking whether he should “offer a general amnesty” to suspended accounts as long as they have not “broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” A day after posting the poll — and after a majority of people voted “yes” — Musk tweeted that he would start reinstating suspended accounts the following week. The move raised immediate concerns about whether bringing back users who have repeatedly violated Twitter’s hate speech policies would create a flood of abuse on the platform.\n\nIn the days prior to reinstating Trump, Musk also reinstated the accounts of comedian Kathy Griffin (who was suspended after she impersonated Musk), controversial psychologist influencer Jordan Peterson, and conservative humor news site Babylon Bee. Peterson and Babylon Bee were both suspended after tweeting anti-trans comments.\n\nThese reinstatements come despite the fact that Musk said he would wait to make any major decisions about reinstating banned accounts until he forms a “content moderation council” to advise him.\n\nGutting Twitter’s staff\n\nMusk began his reign as Twitter’s chief by firing top executives. Within hours of the deal closing, CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and head of legal policy, trust, and safety Vijaya Gadde were shown the door. On November 10, Twitter’s top privacy and security executives resigned, including Chief Information Security Officer Lea Kissner, the company’s chief privacy officer, and chief compliance officer, according to several reports. On the same day, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, who in recent days had publicly reassured people that Twitter was still following its content moderation policies, also left.\n\nThe week after he took over, Musk continued firing executives, including Twitter’s ad chief, general manager of core tech, and chief marketing officer Leslie Berland (who just a few days earlier sent a cheery note announcing that Musk was visiting the San Francisco offices). He also pulled in more than 50 Tesla engineers to work for Twitter and assembled his own circle of trusted advisers.\n\nSoon after, Musk started gutting Twitter’s rank-and-file staff. He laid off an estimated 50 percent — upward of 3,700 employees — from the company. Twitter informed its staff that layoffs would happen by 9 am PT on Friday in a company-wide email. By late Thursday evening, several employees told Recode or posted publicly on Twitter that they had already been locked out of their work email and Slack accounts without any formal notice of whether they had been laid off.\n\nThese cuts are the largest in Twitter’s history, and several current and former employees Recode spoke with are concerned that as a result Twitter’s operations as a platform could be at risk. Musk has also reportedly planned to slash $1 billion from Twitter’s infrastructure costs, such as server space, according to a report from Reuters, furthering those concerns.\n\nAdding to the chaos, Twitter’s management changed its mind about some of its cost-cutting: the company reportedly asked dozens of recently laid-off employees if they wanted to come back to work soon after the layoffs, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe day after the first round of cuts, Musk tweeted about the layoffs and discussed them at an investor conference. He framed the layoffs as necessary because before the deal, “Twitter was having pretty serious revenue challenges and cost challenges,” according to the New York Times.\n\nTwitter’s contract workers were hit heavily by another round of cuts that happened about a week later. Platformer’s Casey Newton reported that around 4,400 out of 5,500 of Twitter’s contractors were laid off, including heavy cuts to Twitter’s content moderation teams. Musk also fired at least twenty employees who posted critical messages about him on Twitter’s internal Slack channels, or who publicly challenged Musk on Twitter.\n\nSome employees are fighting back. Shortly after the initial layoffs, a group of five employees sued Twitter in a class action lawsuit, alleging the company failed to notify them of the impending layoffs as required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN Act, that requires certain employers to give a 60-day notice for mass layoffs in the US. Twitter is giving many laid-off employees full pay and benefits through at least January, although it’s not clear if this applied to all employees, particularly those outside the US, sources said.\n\nA week and a half after the first wave of layoffs, the drama intensified when Musk issued an ultimatum to employees: Work harder or quit. In a midnight email to staff, Musk wrote that, moving forward, Twitter will “need to be extremely hardcore” and require employees to work “long hours at high intensity.” The email linked to a form asking employees to confirm that they want to work at the “new Twitter” by 5 pm ET the next day; if not, they would be laid off and receive three months severance.\n\nThe ultimatum showed how Musk is trying to pare down Twitter’s staff beyond the initial layoffs that gutted half the company.\n\nBut Musk may have gone too far with his demands. In the hours before the deadline, Musk reportedly tried to convince critical employees to stay at the company.\n\nSo far, it’s been reported that 1,200 employees declined to agree to Musk’s terms and essentially mass resigned from the company.\n\nAs concerns grew from some of Twitter’s current and former employees that the site could soon break because of low levels of engineering staffing, Musk asked all engineers who “can actually write software” to meet him in person on the 10th floor of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters and show examples of recent code they were responsible for. He even encouraged staff to fly to San Francisco the same day if need be, according to emails reported by Platformer’s Zoe Schiffer. Ironically, Twitter employees had been locked out of the building until Monday for fear of sabotage, so there was confusion about how people would do this.\n\nShaking up Twitter’s internal culture\n\nMusk has been running Twitter in his own way, similar to how he runs his other companies: in an ad hoc and intense fashion. Rather than talking to his employees first, Musk often tweets whatever he’s thinking, including his plans for the company.\n\nElon’s first message to his staff was in an email sent on November 9 around midnight Pacific time, announcing that he was ending Twitter’s remote-work-for-all policy, effective within hours.\n\nMusk’s intense management style has been an adjustment for many Twitter employees who are used to a more measured, communicative, and structured work culture. One anonymous Twitter employee told the Washington Post that the work atmosphere under Elon was like “working in Trump’s White House.”\n\nEmployees are turning to private or anonymous communication platforms like Blind, Signal, and Discord to commiserate, several employees told Recode, since they no longer feel they can be candid on internal Slack or email.\n\nAnother major change Elon is making to Twitter’s internal culture is to drastically ramp up the pace at which new features are developed.\n\nNormally, product changes like the ones that Musk proposed — such as charging users for verification — would take months or even years to implement at Twitter. Now, employees are being asked to execute them almost overnight.\n\nThis could drive the kind of innovation that Twitter, a money-losing business, might need. But it could also leave staff demoralized, or worse, compromise the reliability and security the app provides to its hundreds of millions of users. Twitter already has existing problems on this front: Former Twitter head of security and internal whistleblower Peiter Zatko warned that the platform “was over a decade behind industry security standards” in September.\n\nMaking people pay for blue check marks\n\nThe first official product change Musk confirmed after taking over Twitter was to start charging $8 per month for “blue check marks,” the verification badges that Twitter currently gives to public figures like journalists, politicians, and celebrities. Musk wanted to open up check marks to more people, as long as they’re willing to pay that price.\n\nTwitter will also give your account more priority in replies, mentions, and search if you subscribe for the new service — meaning that those who don’t pay up could lose visibility on the platform.\n\nTwitter’s verification program was originally designed to make sure people really are who they say they are online. Before you got a check mark, you had to apply for one and show ID proving your real identity matched your Twitter name. That helped Twitter’s user base make sure that the account they were looking at wasn’t an imposter.\n\nNow, Musk has removed any kind of ID verification from Twitter Blue. That means anyone who pays $8 a month can pretend to be someone else, with a check mark next to their name. That’s caused major trolling, with some Twitter Blue accounts impersonating famous people like LeBron James, George W. Bush, and even Mario, the Nintendo character. Many of the new fake accounts use realistic profile photos, names, and handles, and have a check mark next to their name, so it’s hard to tell who’s real or who’s fake.\n\nElon seems to find all this amusing, replying with crying-of-laughter emojis to several tweets pointing out the fake accounts.\n\nThis change also caused major debate among notable figures who got their check mark for free — many of whom said they aren’t willing to pay to keep their verification. Fellow billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban criticized the new feature, saying Musk “killed the most valuable part of Twitter” by making it harder for him to find trustworthy information about breaking news events.\n\nAfter a group of people including comedian Kathy Griffin began trolling Musk’s new policy by changing their names to “Elon Musk” and making fun of the tech CEO, Musk suspended their accounts and announced new rules: Any Twitter accounts involved in impersonation not clearly labeled as “parody” would be immediately suspended without warning, and any verified user who changes their Twitter name will temporarily have their check mark removed.\n\nMusk also made another sudden change when he axed a new “Official” gray check mark (in addition to the blue one) rolled out on Thursday — meant to distinguish verified users who are also notable public figures. Within hours of the release, Musk tweeted that he “killed” the feature, and the new check marks left as quickly as they arrived.\n\nShortly after the feature was pulled back, Musk tweeted this explanation: “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”\n\nBut Musk announced another delay on November 21st when he said he would postpone the relaunch of the service until, “there is high confidence of stopping impersonation.”\n\nEmboldening the trolls\n\nMusk has said his primary reason for buying Twitter was to make it a haven for free speech. He’s echoed conservatives’ longstanding concerns that Twitter is politically biased against right-wing speech despite the lack of evidence of that bias.\n\nConservative politicians like former president Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) have celebrated Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter as a major win, with Trump saying he’s happy that Twitter “will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs.”\n\nBut Musk’s more laissez-faire philosophy on content moderation has also caused another group of people to celebrate: trolls spreading racist, sexist, and otherwise hateful speech.\n\nRelated Quitting Elon\n\nOne example: There was a 500 percent increase in uses of the n-word on Twitter in the 12 hours after Musk’s deal was completed, according to a study from the Network Contagion Research Institute, even though none of Twitter’s rules have changed on the matter.\n\nTwitter has said it’s working on reducing the visibility of these posts. But data points like this have spooked several major advertisers that don’t want their brand affiliated with offensive content, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, and Pfizer — who have are waiting to see more about what direction the company will take under Musk’s leadership before they resume ads.\n\nMusk has tried to calm down advertiser concerns by tweeting a public note saying that he doesn’t want Twitter to turn into a “free-for-all hellscape.” On Thursday, Musk spoke with leaders of civil rights groups like the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and Color of Change, promising them that Twitter takes hate speech seriously, and that he won’t make any major decisions about reinstating banned accounts (e.g., Trump) until after he sets up a content moderation advisory council, which he said will at least take several weeks.\n\nMusk also told civil rights leaders he would reverse his decision to limit the amount of staff who can access content moderation systems, another one of their concerns.\n\nBut civil rights leaders organizing under the banner “#StopToxicTwitter Coalition” said that Musk had failed to hold true to his promises — and ramped up their demands for major advertisers to pause all ads on the platform, Musk tweeted on Friday that Twitter had a “massive drop in revenue” due to “activist groups” who he accused of trying to “destroy free speech in America.”\n\nIt’s not just advertisers that are leaving Twitter because of Elon; there are also early signs that Elon’s takeover and the resulting negativity are causing some users to leave.\n\nOne report in MIT Technology Review estimated some 877,000 accounts were deactivated in the week after Musk’s deal closed. That’s more than double the usual number in that same time period, according to data from the firm Bot Sentinel that MIT Tech Review cited.\n\nSince taking over, Musk has claimed that, to the contrary, Twitter’s daily active users have reached all-time highs.\n\nOf course, these are all estimates, and only from a short window of time. Twitter has also been losing its most valuable “heavy tweeters” in droves for a while now, according to a leaked internal report covered by Reuters, and that predates Musk’s takeover. But time will tell whether Musk reverses or exacerbates Twitter’s existing problem of users fleeing the platform.\n\nThrowing other ideas at the wall\n\nAside from charging for Twitter verification, Musk has been planning a whole new set of changes to the platform. While none of these are confirmed yet, they’re reportedly in the works or being tested.\n\nTwitter is considering entering the payments business — an area Musk has experience in going back to his pre-PayPal days — according to a New York Times report citing paperwork filed with the US Treasury Department. It could be part of Musk’s stated ambitions to make Twitter a “superapp” called X, which could be similar to WeChat in China that’s used not just for posting messages but for things like making shopping purchases or ordering food delivery.\n\nOtherwise, it seems as though Elon is throwing a bunch of ideas out to see which ones work. As one investor in Musk’s deal, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, said at the Web Summit conference in November, he expects only 10 percent of Musk’s ideas “will stick.”\n\nSo far, many of Musk’s ideas (like Vine and paid videos) are old ones that Twitter has already tried — and failed at.\n\nOver time, it will become clear if Musk will be able to successfully resurrect these old ideas — and his new ones, like paying for a check mark — with a very different work culture and staff than Twitter had before.\n\nWe’ll keep updating this post as Musk continues to shape Twitter, for better or worse.",

        "content": "Almost exactly three years before Elon Musk finalized his purchase of Twitter this week, he tweeted his thoughts on the platform’s primary financial engine: “I hate advertising.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Musk extended a truce of sorts to Twitter’s advertisers, saying in a tweet that he aims to make Twitter “the most respected advertising platform in the world.”\n\nHe explained that he bought the company “because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square” and because he feared that social media was in danger of splintering into echo chambers “that generate more hate and divide our society.”\n\nHe sought to ease Madison Avenue’s fears about brand safety — that their ads could appear next to distasteful content and be soiled by association — by stressing that “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!” Without making any promises about content moderation, which many advertising trade groups have encouraged in recent years, Mr. Musk promised a platform that followed government regulations and was “warm and welcoming to all.”\n\nBob Hoffman, the advertising industry veteran behind the Ad Contrarian newsletter said in an email that advertisers were unclear which Musk — the free-speech absolutist or the savvy businessman — was now at the helm.\n\n“If it’s the ‘free-speech absolutist,’ he’s in big trouble,” he wrote. “If Twitter becomes the go-to platform for the knucklehead brigade, advertisers will run, not walk.”\n\nMr. Hoffman noted that, while many companies felt that they had to advertise on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, few felt the same for Twitter.\n\n“Twitter occupies a different place in the social media pantheon,” he said. “This is a difficult position to be in because any reason to bail is reason enough.”\n\nGeneral Motors, a competitor to Mr. Musk’s electric vehicle business Tesla, said in a statement on Friday that it would suspend its advertising on Twitter but continue to use the platform to interact with users.\n\n“We are engaging with Twitter to understand the direction of the platform under their new ownership,” the company said. “As is normal course of business with a significant change in a media platform, we have temporarily paused our paid advertising.”\n\nEven before Mr. Musk began pursuing Twitter, many advertising executives complained that the company’s ability to target ads trailed that of competitors like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Many had said they would consider moving their business elsewhere if Mr. Musk’s permissive attitude toward free speech risked putting their campaigns in proximity to hate speech and conspiracy theories.\n\nTwo advertising executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss potential plans, said some clients had indicated that they would pause business with Twitter in order to evaluate their options while others are considering leaving the platform entirely if former President Donald J. Trump were allowed to resume tweeting. Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was suspended after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nArun Kumar, the chief data and technology officer at the ad giant IPG, said Mr. Musk’s message to advertisers made it clear that he did not want them to leave Twitter.\n\n“The attitude is more or less just wait and watch,” Mr. Kumar said of clients. “Advertisers still share the same concerns around content moderation that existed before, and, given the economic environment right now, any missteps and there will be quick reactions.”\n\nTwitter’s advertising sales, which make up more than 90 percent of its total revenue, have been on the upswing, totaling $2.18 billion in the first half of the year (revenue sources like subscriptions have been declining). The top five advertisers this year on the platform — HBO, Mondelez, Amazon, IBM and PepsiCo — spent more than $155 million through this week, according to estimates from the advertising analytics platform Pathmatics.\n\nHBO said in a statement that it “will be assessing the platform under its new leadership” and that it will “determine appropriate next steps.” The other companies did not immediately provide comment on Mr. Musk’s ownership of Twitter.",

        "content": "This, though, is just one possibility in the era of Musk, which is just beginning. Now that “the bird is freed,” as he wrote Thursday after officially taking over, many users are concerned that after years of slow improvements to the site’s functionality, policies, and moderation processes, the billionaire’s buyout will broadly result in its degradation.\n\nThese fears aren’t without justification: while so much of what Musk will do leaves us guessing, he has been clear that under his leadership, there will be sweeping policy changes. In addition to potentially following the local laws of authoritarian governments, this could include a loosening up of the platform’s speech rules and a user authentication requirement that would challenge the ability of users to remain anonymous. He has also made a number of pithy and sometimes contradictory statements about how he believes the site should moderate content—among them, that Twitter should and will remove only speech that is illegal.\n\nAnd there are already moves that we don’t have to guess about. While Musk recently walked back claims that he planned to lay off one-third of the company’s workforce, it was reported late on Thursday that top executives had been fired and “hastily escorted” from the company’s headquarters. This included Vijaya Gadde, the company’s head of legal policy, trust, and safety, whom Musk had antagonized in an April tweet.\n\nGadde’s tenure was not without controversy, but under her leadership the legal team made significant policy strides, many of which aimed at protecting the platform’s most vulnerable users. Twitter pushed back at attempts by US courts to unmask anonymous users; cracked down on botnets and other influence operations; worked with the government of New Zealand to develop tools to facilitate independent research on the impacts of user interactions with algorithmic systems; banned political ads in the run-up to the 2020 US elections; and hired researchers to study the health of discourse on the site.\n\nFor many of Twitter’s vulnerable users, these changes represented great strides from its early days as the “free speech wing of the free speech party,” where just about anything—including terrorist content, harassment, and hate speech—could be found. But Musk has stated that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” While he’s recently tempered earlier statements by saying that he won’t turn Twitter into a “free-for-all hellscape,” it seems pretty clear that the new chief intends to roll back some of Twitter’s rules.\n\nMusk has also said that he would cut back on Twitter’s attempts to fight mis- and disinformation. This would be a mistake. Twitter has carefully crafted policies and tools that allow for free discourse while inhibiting the spread of false content, such as prompts that encourage users to actually read what they’re sharing, and labels that provide additional context to potential misinformation. With major elections approaching in dozens of countries in the coming two years, these tools are essential for ensuring that Twitter remains a space for civic engagement.",

The company was benefiting from a flood of funding into the social-networking space, eventually leading to an IPO in 2013 that raised $1.8 billion.\n\nNow the company is back in private hands. And they happen to be the hands of Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and one of the app's most high-profile provocateurs.\n\nIt's a massive moment. Twitter has become a key place for people to debate, joke and pontificate in their own circles of politics, sports, tech and finance. It's also served as a platform that gives voice to the voiceless, helping protesters organize and express themselves in repressed regimes around the world.\n\nIn recent years, however, Twitter and social media rivals like Facebook have been at the center of controversy over the distribution of fake news and misinformation, sometimes leading to bullying and violence.\n\nInvestors had grown concerned about Twitter as a business. The company was generally unprofitable, struggled to keep pace with Google and Facebook, and often killed popular products with no real explanation.\n\nWhat follows is a brief history of Twitter, which — despite its many flaws — is one of the most iconic companies to come out of Silicon Valley in the past 20 years.\n\n2006\n\nIn March, Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams created Twitter, which was originally a side project stemming from the podcasting tool Odeo. That month, Dorsey would send the first Tweet that read, \"just setting up my twttr.\"\n\n2007\n\nIn July, Twitter received a $100,000 Series A funding round led by Union Square Ventures. The app's popularity started to explode after being heavily promoted by the tech community during the annual South by Southwest conference.\n\n2008\n\nDorsey stepped down as CEO in October, and was replaced by Williams. According to the book \"Hatching Twitter\" by journalist Nick Bilton, Twitter's board fired Dorsey over concerns about the executive's management style and public boastings.\n\n2009\n\nTwitter's popularity continued to soar, leading to a high-profile appearance from Williams on Oprah Winfrey's talk show alongside celebrity Ashton Kutcher. Kutcher would also write about Williams and Stone as part of Time Magazine's Time 100 issue. Twitter was now a mainstream phenomenon.\n\n2010\n\nTwitter reached space, with NASA Astronaut Timothy Creamer sending the first tweet live from outer orbit. Behind the scenes, however, management woes continued with Williams stepping down as CEO, replaced by operating chief Dick Costolo.\n\n2011\n\nTwitter became an essential social media tool used during the Arab Spring, the wave of antigovernmental protests throughout Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. Protesters used the site to post reports and to organize. As the Pew Research Center noted, Twitter's role in \"disseminating breaking news\" was not \"not limited to the Arab uprisings – the death of Whitney Houston, for example, was announced on Twitter 55 minutes prior to the AP confirming the story.\"\n\n2012\n\nTwitter's reach expanded to 200 million active users. Barack Obama used the \"platform to first declare victory publicly in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, with a Tweet that was viewed approximately 25 million times on our platform and widely distributed offline in print and broadcast media,\" according to corporate filings.\n\n2013\n\nTwitter went public in November. The combined wealth of Williams, Dorsey, and Costolo hit roughly $4 billion.\n\n\"I think we've got a tremendous set of thoughts and strategies to increase the slope of the growth curve,\" Costolo told CNBC at the time. \"I would consider some of them tactics, some of them broader strategies, in service of doing what I referred to as bridge the gap between the massive awareness of Twitter and deep engagement of the platform.\"",

And he hasn’t wasted any time making changes.\n\nThe South Africa-born entrepreneur has already dismissed chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal and general counsel Vijaya Gadde.\n\nHowever, according to reports, Mr Musk told staff during his visit that it was not true that he was planning on cutting up to 75% of Twitter staff after acquiring the company.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Mr Musk told investors he planned to cut around three-quarters of the firm’s 7,500 employees.\n\nParag Agrawal has been fired as CEO of Twitter (Credit: Getty)\n\nStaff, Twitter users and industry experts are waiting to see what plans Musk has for the platform.\n\nHe has previously spoken of his belief in ‘absolute free speech’ and suggested he would allow previously suspended and often controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump, to return to the platform, which has alarmed online safety campaigners.\n\nWhat will Twitter look like under Elon Musk?\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla boss said his reasons for acquiring Twitter were ‘because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.’\n\nHowever, he has insisted the social platform won’t become a ‘hellscape’ under his watch.\n\nHe added: ‘In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.’\n\nTwitter staff are trying to keep morale high after Musk’s takeover (Credit: Twitter)\n\nWriting in The Conversation, Erik Gordon, a Professor of Business at the University of Michigan, says Musk will look to take the company private to maximise his control over it.\n\n‘Once the shares change hands, Twitter will be Musk’s to do with as he pleases – from reopening the accounts of former President Donald Trump and Ye, the artist formally known as Kanye West, to slashing the workforce by up to 75%.\n\n‘Musk understood the physics of launching rockets and the engineering behind building an electric car, but he doesn’t have deep experience running a social media platform or in building super apps. I believe he doesn’t have a thoroughly thought-out strategy that fits Twitter’s difficult environment.\n\n‘What he will have is a huge amount of debt. Last year, Twitter owed about $51 million in interest on its debt. After going private, the estimates are that Twitter will owe at least a billion dollars annually on about $13 billion in new debt.’\n\nNed Segal, the chief financial officer of Twitter, has also been fired by Musk (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n‘In 2021, the company generated just $630 million in cash from operations. That means Musk won’t have much cash to fund a super app or any other big ideas, unless he is able to attract additional investment in the company.\n\n‘With the company in his hands, Musk can, of course, do what he likes. He can implement any free speech policy that suits his fancy. He can let Trump and Ye tweet. He can ban Tesla short sellers and anyone who questions his foreign policy initiatives. He can fire 75% of his staff in a heartbeat – something a public CEO would have a very hard time doing.’\n\nThe return of Donald Trump and ‘free speech’\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss has said he believes strongly in absolute free speech, to the extent that anything that is not illegal should be allowed to stay online.\n\nAnd he has confirmed he would allow banned accounts, such as that of former US president Donald Trump, to return to help achieve Twitter’s mission to be an unfiltered ‘common digital town square’.\n\nElon Musk has indicated that Donald Trump could be reinstated on Twitter (Credits: AP)\n\nMusk has said he believes it is ‘important to the future of civilisation’ to have a space where ‘a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner’.\n\nThis stance would be likely to face significant issues once the Online Safety Bill comes into effect in the UK.\n\nWhile the Bill has pledged to protect free speech through protections around content of democratic importance and from news publishers, it will require platforms not just to take down any illegal content but also any topics which have been designated ‘legal but harmful’, which is likely to be content linked to abuse or harassment, among other things.\n\nWith large fines and even the prospect of being banned from the UK as potential penalties, Musk is likely to have to soften his stance on absolute free speech if he wants Twitter to stay on the right side of regulators.\n\nAdvertisers too are unlikely to be happy about the possibility of their adverts appearing alongside increasingly controversial content.\n\nThe everything app\n\nA key moment in this takeover saga came when Musk confirmed he would go ahead with the deal and said buying the platform was ‘an accelerant to creating X, the everything app’.\n\nThe billionaire has spoken broadly in the past about his support for the idea of an ‘everything app’ – a single place where users can access most, if not all, of their favourite online services and utilities.\n\nMusk could use Twitter to form the basis of an ‘everything app’ (Credit: Getty)\n\nIn China, a version of the everything app idea already exists in WeChat, which began life as a messaging platform similar to WhatsApp, but has since become a mini-internet within a single app – allowing users to do everything from share social media-style posts with friends, to getting news, making mobile payments, booking restaurants and ordering taxis.\n\nNothing similar exists in the West.\n\nSome experts have questioned Musk’s ability or even desire to actually create such a service, but no-one can match the resources he has – he is the world’s wealthiest person – and he has experience in digital payments through PayPal and transport through Tesla which could help bring together different services in one place.\n\nInside the company\n\nMusk’s public sparring with Twitter and criticism of the company in the months before the takeover has not sat well with some Twitter staff, with reports of many even planning to leave once the takeover was closed over their fears about Musk’s proposed new direction for the company.\n\nMusk has been pictured inside the Twitter HQ talking to staff (Credit: Twitter)\n\nIndustry analyst Mike Proulx said earlier this month that ‘earning and retaining the trust’ of Twitter’s employees should be Musk’s ‘number one mission’.\n\n‘Twitter remains an important part of our culture regardless of the ongoing drama around this on-again, off-again, and back-on-again deal,’ he said.\n\n‘Twitter’s future is bleak without an engaged employee base and there’s a lot of repair work to be done there.’\n\nMusk’s dismissing of the senior staff has already caused alarm among some online safety campaigners, who have warned that a shift in Twitter’s policy around safety and free speech could make the platform more dangerous, while others have suggested the internal turmoil during Musk’s restructuring could make the platform more vulnerable to hackers.\n\nArrow MORE: Elon Musk confirms he has bought Twitter\n\nArrow MORE: Elon Musk enters Twitter headquarters carrying kitchen sink and changes profile to ‘Chief Twit’",

But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October. It is the latest step in a battle that began in April with Musk signing a deal to acquire Twitter, then tried to back out of it, leading Twitter to sue the Tesla CEO to force him to go through with the acquisition. If the two sides don't meet Friday's deadline, the next step could be a November trial that could lead to a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal.\n\nBut Musk has been signaling that the deal is going through. He strolled into the company's San Francisco headquarters Wednesday carrying a porcelain sink, changed his Twitter profile to \"Chief Twit,\" and tweeted \"Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!\"\n\nAnd overnight the New York Stock Exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of Twitter before the opening bell Friday in anticipation of the company going private under Musk.\n\nMusk is expected to speak to Twitter employees directly Friday if the deal is finalized, according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets. Despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company's culture and operations, Twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed Musk's arrival and messaging.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTop sales executive Sarah Personette, the company's chief customer officer, said she had a \"great discussion\" with Musk on Wednesday and appeared to endorse his Thursday message to advertisers.\n\n\"Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,\" Personette tweeted Thursday. \"Looking forward to the future!\"\n\nMusk's apparent enthusiasm about visiting Twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions: The building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of Twitter's 7,500 workers when he becomes owner of the company. The newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation.\n\nMusk has spent months deriding Twitter's \"spam bots\" and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about Twitter's problems and how to fix them. But he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform.\n\nThursday's note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more \"relevant ads\" — which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users' personal information.\n\nYildirim said that, unlike Facebook, Twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see. Musk's message suggests he wants to fix that, she said.\n\nInsider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said Musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of Twitter's ad business because Twitter's revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy, months of uncertainty surrounding Musk's proposed takeover, changing consumer behaviors and the fact that \"there's no other revenue source waiting in the wings.\"\n\n\"Even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers, many of whom already find Twitter's brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms,\" Enberg said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States on Wednesday, an extraordinary comeback for a former president who refused to accept defeat four years ago, sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was convicted of felony charges and survived two assassination attempts.\n\nWith a win in Wisconsin, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency.\n\nThe victory validates his bare-knuckle approach to politics. He attacked his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in deeply personal – often misogynistic and racist – terms as he pushed an apocalyptic picture of a country overrun by violent migrants. The coarse rhetoric, paired with an image of hypermasculinity, resonated with angry voters – particularly men – in a deeply polarized nation.\n\n“I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” Trump told throngs of cheering supporters in Florida even before his victory was confirmed.\n\nIn state after state, Trump outperformed what he did in the 2020 election while Harris failed to do as well as Joe Biden did in winning the presidency four years ago. Upon taking office again, Trump also will work with a Senate that will now be in Republican hands, while control of the House hadn’t been determined.\n\n“We’ve been through so much together, and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory,” Trump said. “This was something special and we’re going to pay you back,” he said.\n\nIn his second term, Trump has vowed to pursue an agenda centered on dramatically reshaping the federal government and pursuing retribution against his perceived enemies.\n\nLIVE: Electoral College Calculator\n\nThe results cap a historically tumultuous and competitive election season that included two assassination attempts targeting Trump and a shift to a new Democratic nominee just a month before the party’s convention. Trump will inherit a range of challenges when he assumes office on Jan. 20, including heightened political polarization and global crises that are testing America’s influence abroad.\n\nHis win against Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, marks the second time he has defeated a female rival in a general election. Harris, the current vice president, rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race amid alarm about his advanced age. Despite an initial surge of energy around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration.\n\nThe vice president has not publicly spoken since the race was called. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, said she would speak Wednesday: “She will be back here tomorrow.”\n\nTrump is the first former president to return to power since Grover Cleveland regained the White House in the 1892 election. He is the first person convicted of a felony to be elected president and, at 78, is the oldest person elected to the office. His vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the U.S. government.\n\nCongratulations started pouring in from world leaders even before Trump’s victory was announced.\n\nThere will be far fewer checks on Trump when he returns to the White House. He has plans to swiftly enact a sweeping agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. His GOP critics in Congress have largely been defeated or retired. Federal courts are now filled with judges he appointed. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, issued a ruling earlier this year affording presidents broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nTrump’s language and behavior during the campaign sparked growing warnings from Democrats and some Republicans about shocks to democracy that his return to power would bring. He repeatedly praised strongman leaders, warned that he would deploy the military to target political opponents he labeled the “enemy from within,” threatened to take action against news organizations for unfavorable coverage and suggested suspending the Constitution.\n\nSERIES: A look at Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ campaign pledges\n\nSome who served in his first White House, including Vice President Mike Pence and John Kelly, Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, either declined to endorse him or issued dire public warnings about his return to the presidency.\n\nWhile Harris focused much of her initial message around themes of joy, Trump channeled a powerful sense of anger and resentment among voters\n\nHe seized on frustrations over high prices and fears about crime and migrants who illegally entered the country on Biden’s watch. He also highlighted wars in the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to cast Democrats as presiding over – and encouraging – a world in chaos.\n\nIt was a formula Trump perfected in 2016, when he cast himself as the only person who could fix the country’s problems, often borrowing language from dictators.\n\n“In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he said in March 2023.\n\nThis campaign often veered into the absurd, with Trump amplifying bizarre and disproven rumors that migrants were stealing and eating pet cats and dogs in an Ohio town. At one point, he kicked off a rally with a detailed story about the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer in which he praised his genitalia.\n\nREAD MORE: 24 things Trump is promising to do\n\nBut perhaps the defining moment came in July when a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump’s ear and killed one of his supporters. His face streaked with blood, Trump stood and raised his fist in the air, shouting “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Weeks later, a second assassination attempt was thwarted after a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through the greenery while Trump was playing golf.\n\nTrump is the first former president to return to power since Grover Cleveland regained the White House in the 1892 election.\n\nTrump’s return to the White House seemed unlikely when he left Washington in early 2021 as a diminished figure whose lies about his defeat sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was so isolated at the time that few outside of his family bothered to attend the send-off he organized for himself at Andrews Air Force Base, complete with a 21-gun salute.\n\nDemocrats who controlled the U.S. House quickly impeached him for his role in the insurrection, making him the only president to be impeached twice. He was acquitted by the U.S. Senate, where many Republicans argued that he no longer posed a threat because he had left office.\n\nBut from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump – aided by some elected Republicans – worked to maintain his political relevance. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who at the time led his party in the U.S. House, visited Trump soon after he left office, essentially validating his continued role in the party.\n\nAs the 2022 midterm election approached, Trump used the power of his endorsement to assert himself as the unquestioned leader of the party. His preferred candidates almost always won their primaries, but some went on to defeat in elections that Republicans viewed as within their grasp. Those disappointing results were driven in part by a backlash to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that revoked a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion, a decision that was aided by Trump-appointed justices. The midterm election prompted questions within the GOP about whether Trump should remain the party’s leader.\n\nBut if Trump’s future was in doubt, that changed in 2023 when he faced a wave of state and federal indictments for his role in the insurrection, his handling of classified information and election interference. He used the charges to portray himself as the victim of an overreaching government, an argument that resonated with a GOP base that was increasingly skeptical – if not outright hostile – to institutions and established power structures.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican nomination, lamented that the indictments “sucked out all the oxygen” from this year’s GOP primary. Trump easily captured his party’s nomination without ever participating in a debate against DeSantis or other GOP candidates.\n\nWhen he becomes president on Jan. 20, Trump could appoint an attorney general who would erase the federal charges.\n\nWith Trump dominating the Republican contest, a New York jury found him guilty in May of 34 felony charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. He faces sentencing later this month, though his victory poses serious questions about whether he will ever face punishment.\n\nHe has also been found liable in two other New York civil cases: one for inflating his assets and another for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996.\n\nTrump is subject to additional criminal charges in an election-interference case in Georgia that has become bogged down. On the federal level, he’s been indicted for his role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election and improperly handling classified material. When he becomes president on Jan. 20, Trump could appoint an attorney general who would erase the federal charges.\n\nAs he prepares to return to the White House, Trump has vowed to swiftly enact a radical agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. That includes plans to launch the largest deportation effort in the nation’s history, to use the Justice Department to punish his enemies, to dramatically expand the use of tariffs and to again pursue a zero-sum approach to foreign policy that threatens to upend longstanding foreign alliances, including the NATO pact.\n\nWhen he arrived in Washington 2017, Trump knew little about the levers of federal power. His agenda was stymied by Congress and the courts, as well as senior staff members who took it upon themselves to serve as guardrails.\n\nThis time, Trump has said he would surround himself with loyalists who will enact his agenda, no questions asked, and who will arrive with hundreds of draft executive orders, legislative proposals and in-depth policy papers in hand.\n\n\n\nColvin reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nFind more of our Vote 2024 coverage",

Additionally, \"the Biden administration very rarely touted their economic accomplishments, … their climate change accomplishments, … [and] their infrastructure and even border control and immigration [accomplishments],\" she said.\n\nTrump attracted new voters.\n\n\"One of the things [Trump] was able to do quite effectively was create a multiracial, multi-ethnic coalition of grievance populism that resulted in a powerful show at the polls,\" Mason said.\n\nTrump received more votes from Latino residents than any other Republican presidential candidate in history, and he also made notable inroads with Black voters. \"But in specific areas, particularly in battleground states, Trump doubled his percentage of support among Black male voters,\" Mason said.\n\nIn Dearborn, Michigan, which usually overwhelmingly back Democrats, as many as \"45% of Muslim residents voted for Donald Trump, 33% voted for Jill Stein, and support for Kamala Harris [dropped to an unprecedented] low 20s,\" said Wright Rigueur, who attributed the shift among Muslim voters to the Biden administration's handled the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nInformation inconsistencies contributed.\n\nHarris made women's reproductive rights a focal point of her campaign, but Trump didn't discuss the matter much, Mason said. When he did, he told audiences he wanted individual states to make the decision. It didn't help that \"a lot of the news sources Republicans tend to consume weren't saying anything about the threat to abortion access or rights,\" she said.\n\nWright Rigueur cited another example: the stimulus relief bill passed by Congress at the end of Trump's first presidency. Trump wanted to veto the bill \"but later had no choice but to sign it into law,\" she said. He then decided to put his name on the checks. \"Everybody laughed and [thought] it was arrogant, but people remember those checks and say, 'Donald Trump gave me $1,200.'\"\n\nWhat they don't remember, she continued, is the second round of $1,200 relief checks sent by Joe Biden. Why? Biden didn't print his name on the checks—he followed standard practice and had the Secretary of the Treasury sign them.\n\nResults reflect a global trend.\n\nIn elections worldwide, incumbent candidates are losing, and the Harris defeat is yet another example, Mason said.\n\n\"In response to inflation or to the trauma of COVID, the whole world is still trying to process fear and uncertainty,\" Mason explained. \"When [people] are uncertain, they tend to go toward a strongman\" or anti-establishment leader who isn't the incumbent.\n\nSimilarly, fear and uncertainty have fueled what some panelists called \"an anti-institution movement\"—that is, a growing distrust in the government agencies, universities, schools, and medical systems entrusted to take care of, educate, and advance society.\n\n\"Institutions have different rules than rogue actors or extremist groups,\" Mason said, \"and they're being scapegoated because they don't really fight back—they have to obey their own rules about inclusion and diversity and freedom of speech and pluralism.\"\n\nPolitical parties shifted.\n\nThe Republican base is now largely made up of the working class, panelists said.\n\n\"The Democratic coalition today is massively, disproportionately represented by professionals, university professors, experts, [and] all of those people who, to some degree, are the enforcers of propriety,\" Teles said.\n\nThe business community used to be an \"anchor tenant\" of the Republican Party, Teles added, and it remains to be seen whether \"Trump will just accept that a lot of business is going to leave the Republican Party, and that they'll pick up enough working-class party voters to be OK with business [primarily] ending up in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAccording to Dayton, \"if you are working in a high-skill information industry, [you're likely] going Democrat fast. If you're in an extractive industry [such as] agriculture and mining, you're going to have strong reasons to like Trump.\"\n\nTrump's style remains controversial.\n\nPanelists brought up concerns about Trump's unorthodox style on and off throughout the conversation. \"I'm of the firm belief that one of the reasons Trump did as well as he did, compared to 2020, is because he's not on TV every day,\" Scott said. \"If Trump continues being who he was, … I think people's tolerance for decency—or indecency, I should say—will be tested.\"\n\nNevertheless, many voters overlooked Trump's idiosyncrasies to cast a vote for him anyway.\n\n\"The reality is that too many voters are far less concerned about that than they are about their rent going up, the cost of X going up, higher education being incredibly unaffordable, and so many other issues affecting voters' day-to-day,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's agenda and power are still up in the air.\n\nJust because the Republican Party swept the Senate and is likely to narrowly control the House doesn't mean Trump will have unlimited power. As Scott said, \"the president has put forward an agenda and ideas, and he has said some things he'll do, but the reality is that he's not a king.\"\n\nDayton said much or some of what Trump campaigned on likely won't actually happen. The first Trump administration wanted to cut NSF funding, for example, but our \"Republican-led Congress gave [the funding] 20 to 30% increases every year.\"\n\n\"I have trouble seeing a world with massive cuts to science because we know that's a source of growth, and we've seen those budgets maintained across administrations,\" Dayton said. \"All of these people understand—and I put J.D. Vance at the top of this list—that research is a massive driver of economic growth and opportunity.\"\n\nScott said he knows many people are scared right now, including his students at Harvard, who expressed alarm after the election. \"I encourage people to not assume the worst will happen every single time,\" he said, adding that Trump tried to overturn the Affordable Care Act during his first administration, but it didn't happen.\n\n\"There is not a single president you can name who achieved everything he campaigned on, not just because of his political opponents but also because of people within their [own] party, and because the reality of making certain things happen is not as easy as giving a speech saying you're going to make something happen,\" Scott said.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office.",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has decisively won reelection to the White House, a political outcome that began reverberating around the globe in the hours after the polls closed Tuesday. After polling for weeks had shown a too-close-to-call race that might take days to conclude, Trump’s clear win struck many as a shock.\n\nAnalysts will likely need years to fully understand the forces that drove his return to power. But on the day after, top UC Berkeley scholars offer a sharp and sometimes unsettling assessment of the dynamics at play. Some cite Trump’s appeal to white voters, who looked past the insurrection against democracy on Jan. 6, 2021. One says that Americans are not ready to trust a woman with presidential power. And others say Trump’s victory reflects a global rage against political leadership and warn that it could help fuel a new era of global instability.\n\nBelow, read a full range of responses to the election results by UC Berkeley experts in political science, sociology, international relations and other fields.\n\nWhat is your main takeaway from the election results that will bring Donald Trump back to the White House?\n\nEric Schickler\n\nThere are many takeaways from the election results. But the most important implication is that just four years after the Jan. 6 insurrection, former President Trump will be back in the White House — now surrounded by staff and agency leaders who will be more committed to him both personally and to his agenda.\n\nWith a Republican Senate (and likely House), he will be able to make some major legislative changes, especially when it comes to taxes. But as head of the executive branch, he will be in a position to act unilaterally on a host of other issues, pushing the limits of presidential power. With a supportive Supreme Court, the implications for policy and governance are hard to overstate.\n\n— Eric Schickler, political scientist and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS)\n\nYou’ve spoken about how economic insecurity led white men, in particular, to support Trump and stick with him. What does his defeat of Kamala Harris tell you about the enduring power of that demographic’s political beliefs and power?\n\nI see the outcome of the presidential election fundamentally as an expression of anger about the state of the economy. As the saying goes, “It is the economy, stupid.” The economy is working well for some groups of people, to be sure, but there are different economies for different sets of people.\n\nRaka Ray\n\nBut it’s also not just “the economy, stupid.” I would never discount the racist and misogynist rejection of a Black and South Asian woman; the deliberately circulated fears and lies that fed the wounded racial and masculine identity of particular demographic groups; the willingness of some immigrants to shut the door behind them; and the bogey figure of “trans” that came to stand in for historic changes that were hard to grapple with. Neither would I discount the effect of the global conflicts in which America is implicated.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I do not believe that these results would have occurred if large populations of Americans did not worry about the cost of groceries, utilities and rents. The success of a political party depends on its responsiveness to its constituents — not just as a pool of votes, but also to the social and political movements through which they express themselves. There are lessons here that the Democratic Party has, unfortunately, consistently failed to heed.\n\n— Raka Ray, dean of UC Berkeley Social Sciences and professor of sociology and South Asian studies\n\nBefore the election, a Berkeley IGS Poll found that even in California, support for Kamala Harris was significantly less than Joe Biden’s 2020 support among Asian American and Latinx voters, and particularly men in those communities. An exit poll this morning showed that Latinx men really moved toward Trump. Do you have any insights as to why so many in these communities turned from Harris or were drawn to Trump?\n\nThere has been much discussion this election about growing support for Trump among non-white voters, but little focus on the ongoing and growing support for Trump among white voters, particularly white women. Many pundits assumed white women would turn out for Harris because of their concerns about reproductive justice. Yet, we must remember that white women have only voted Democratic once in the past 50 years: That was in 1996, in favor of Bill Clinton.\n\nLisa García Bedolla\n\nLooking at voters of color, although it is true that Latine men seemed to be more supportive of Trump this cycle, I would be very skeptical of exit poll results that are significantly different from high-quality survey results taken shortly before the election. Exit polls have many methodological problems and are particularly bad at identifying trends within ethno-racial subpopulations. In October, Latine polling by Equis Research found about 55% Latine support for Harris in the battleground states, with stronger support among Latina women. There is no reason to believe things looked significantly different on Election Day.\n\nA more useful question is to consider the reasons underlying Trump’s appeal to voters. Many pundits have questioned how voters could support Trump in spite of his racist and misogynist statements. I would argue that many voters supported him because of these assertions. It was not only that many saw those controversial words as proof of his willingness to speak the “truth.” For some voters, Trump’s words made them feel powerful, gave them someone to blame for their problems, and made them feel confident he could fix them.\n\n— Lisa García Bedolla, political scientist, vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division\n\nDemocrats have nominated women as their presidential candidates twice in the past eight years, and both have lost. To what extent do you think gender played a role in the outcome, especially this year?\n\nAmong the many sociocultural factors affecting presidential elections, gender has been a defining dynamic for the last three cycles, with voters facing choices between male and female candidates for both presidential and vice presidential positions. The gender dynamics of the most recent election were intensified by contentious debates over reproductive rights and their disproportionate impact on women, as well as by one candidate’s explicit embrace of hypermasculinity.\n\nLaura Kray\n\nTwo fundamental questions emerged: whether voters would choose between dominant versus prestigious leadership styles, and whether America was ready to advance toward greater gender equality by electing a woman to the world’s most powerful position. The results appear to confirm that most American voters still implicitly endorse traditional gender hierarchies in political leadership, maintaining a system where men hold predominant power and authority.\n\nThe voting patterns across these recent elections reflect deeper societal dynamics around gender and power, suggesting that our society remains more comfortable with women in supporting roles rather than as the primary decision-maker, metaphorically preferring men at the helm while women occupy the passenger seat. While Americans may support women’s advancement in principle, electoral behavior continues to reflect weak implicit (and explicit) associations between the concepts of women and power.\n\n— Laura Kray, psychologist and director of the Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership at the Haas School of Business\n\nWhy is hate and fear-mongering so motivating? Why did the GOP choose to capitalize on anti-trans hate in this election?\n\nThroughout their presidential campaign, the Republican Party used — which is to say produced — an atmosphere of anti-trans hate to move people to the polls, and it seems to have worked. For years, a coalition which includes many self-identified conservatives, along with their liberal co-conspirators, have seeded a trans panic on the local level, whether at school boards, libraries, sports fields and medical facilities.\n\nEric A. Stanley\n\nAs I’ve argued in my most recent book, anti-trans hate is so wildly successful because it makes the public fearfully obsessed with trans people. Ironically, many conservative commentators spend more hours per day talking about gender than I do as a professor who studies it. Of course, much of what they say is factually incorrect. However, they own the means of distribution, and so it is received as truth.\n\nThat said, anti-trans antagonism is a bipartisan affair. While the Republicans have been loud and clear about their will to eradicate trans people, Democrats have remained mostly silent. One could speculate that they fear the vitriol many of us survive, or perhaps they passively agree. Either way, it is illustrative of the Democratic Party’s move further toward the right which helped them lose the election.\n\n— Eric A. Stanley, Haas Distinguished Chair in LGBT Equity\n\nWas there a flaw, or a failure, in the Democrats’ strategy or tactics in this election that contributed to Trump’s win and Harris’ defeat?\n\nHarris launched strong, but after her great performance in the Sept. 10 debate, she and her party reverted to their ultra-risk-averse, low-dominance ways.\n\nM. Steven Fish\n\nHarris largely dropped the hard-edged, provocative spirit of her DNC speech and the debate. In interviews, she offered evasive, scripted, chutzpah-free answers, creating the impression that she was just a typical politician. Instead of staying on offense and limiting their attention to Trump largely to ridiculing him, the Democrats fell back on their timeworn, futile tactic of ceding the spotlight to him, repeating his outrageous statements and enjoining everyone to be fearful and offended.\n\nRather than forcefully celebrating the roaring economy, Harris remained wedded to the 21st century Democrats’ delusion that you score more points — even when the economy is sizzling and you’re in power — by expressing sympathy for supposedly suffering voters. Harris could have honored Americans’ bootstrap mentality and leveraged their patriotism, casting her program as a pro-growth dynamo that would send wages and corporate profits soaring and ensure that the American economy continues to leave the rest of the world in the dust.\n\nInstead, she played Santa Claus: a $50,000 tax credit for first-time business starters, $25,000 for first-time homebuyers, a $6,000 credit for newborns.\n\nHarris is a strong leader and a diehard patriot, and Trump is a coward at heart and a traitor to boot. Tragically, the Democrats neglected to show it.\n\n— M. Steven Fish, political scientist, author of “Comeback: Routing Trumpism, Reclaiming the Nation, and Restoring Democracy’s Edge”\n\nThe reflexive, morning-after worry is that U.S. democracy will literally and directly be at risk in a second Trump term. Is that a valid concern?\n\nDemocratic institutions in the U.S. continue to be under strain. It is a challenge for any country to have a national executive who has attempted to subvert a previous election.\n\nJake Grumbach\n\nOne concern is that the executive branch will use its authority to influence the administration of the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential elections. A second concern is that the reelection of a politician who has attempted election subversion will incentivize and embolden other politicians to threaten the rule of law and peaceful transfer of power. A third concern is that the “stop the steal” conspiracy about the 2020 election will continue to be popular, leading to further distrust in U.S. election administration.\n\nThis election has made clear that a majority of Americans are willing to vote for a candidate who threatens the rule of law, a serious concern of the Founders.\n\n— Jacob Grumbach, political scientist, leader of the Democracy Policy Lab at the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nTo what extent do you feel conspiracy theories or conspiratorial thinking shaped the outcome of this election? Why does conspiracy thinking have such power over much of the electorate?\n\nThe United States has always been a nation of conspiracy theorists, and once again we will have a conspiracy theorist-in-chief. American politics have long been shaped by fears of conspiracy, from the colonial-era Illuminati to Henry Ford’s antisemitism. In 1965, historian Richard Hofstadter critiqued the “paranoid style” of demagogues and populists on the (mostly right-wing) fringe as the price society paid for consensus at the “vital center.”\n\nMichael Mark Cohen\n\nBut in the post-9/11 era, these fringes have conquered whatever remained of liberal society. Trump began his political rise with the “birther” conspiracy. His Muslim ban and border wall were not just nativist slogans, but solutions to the perceived threat of infiltrators seeking to “replace” white voters. And there was the “big lie” of 2020, in which massive voter fraud (now magically vanquished) prevented his re-election.\n\nThis new administration will be staffed with conspiracy theorists like Stephen Miller and RFK Jr., who promise to deliver Trump’s vengeance. Within the grip of paranoia, every accusation is both projection and a confession, and those who imagine themselves victims of conspiracy tend to conspire against others. But now, instead of this being a fringe fantasy, Trump’s authoritarian, if not openly fascist, conspiracy theories will be backed by the might of the American Empire.\n\n— Michael Mark Cohen, associate teaching professor of American studies and African American studies\n\nPut Trump’s victory in an international context: In tone and substance, does it parallel upheavals happening in other parts of the world?\n\nDonald Trump’s election fits a pattern of populist-nationalist insurgencies that have roiled democracies in the decade since Britain’s choice for Brexit. Populist-nationalists, as I would call them, have won elections in Europe, Latin America and South and Southeast Asia. Their insurgencies reflect impatience with incumbents and prevailing policies, but not with democracy itself. Democracy encompasses many varieties of politics, after all, and what we see in this populist-nationalist groundswell is a majoritarian reaction against the liberal-democratic synthesis that achieved broad global influence in the late 20th century.\n\nDaniel Sargent\n\nPut in broader perspective, the efforts of populists like Trump to “take back control,” reestablish borders and draw hard lines between insiders and outsiders aren’t novel; they’re doing what nationalists do. Liberals (like me) lament the populist-nationalist phenomenon, but we should hope — now that Trump has won — that populist-nationalism brings some benefits, especially for those Americans who have borne the brunt of globalization’s downside.\n\nMy deeper worry is for world order: Liberal policies and commitments sustained a tolerable peace and bolstered global prosperity over the past half-century. If history is any guide, the rise of populist-nationalism risks escalating international strife.\n\n— Daniel J. Sargent, historian and co-director of the Institute of International Studies\n\nGlobally, incumbents have recently experienced voters’ anger — it’s not just a U.S. phenomenon. In some cases, this seems to reflect an impatience with democracy itself. How would you explain this global pattern? Are there conditions or characteristics common across countries?\n\nSusan Hyde\n\nIt will take some time before we know exactly whether this election is similar to other countries’ experiences. Populism, frustration with inflation, ethnonationalism, and politician-led manipulation of voter fears about their fellow citizens are common to many elections around the world in recent years.\n\nIs this why Trump won? They are all potentially contributing factors, but I would hesitate before concluding that impatience with democracy itself is a global trend.\n\nRather, I see the global trend as one in which some of the institutional support structures for democratic processes — a strong and independent media at local and national levels, strong political parties, the massive increases in disinformation without any effective counter to it — weaken and make it easier for both populist and nativist politicians to thrive.\n\n— Susan D. Hyde, political scientist and co-director of the Institute of International Studies\n\nWhat did you learn from the election? And what does the future hold?\n\nThis presidential campaign illuminated the tensions between the ideals of American democracy and the human motives that can get in its way.\n\nDavid C. Wilson\n\nFormer President Trump and current Vice President Harris provided clear contrasts in experience, capacity, enthusiasm, optimism and compassion. While Harris provided policy details and offered bipartisan appeals, Trump cast a dark picture of criminal immigration, demonization and a country in decline. To the amazement of many, this appeal worked. One can only conclude that, for a majority of Americans, democracy is less about people and more about power — and who ought to hold it.\n\nA few points from exit polling stand out. While Harris won the women’s vote overall, white women, especially those who are suburban, married or who have no college degree, favored Trump. And while she won voters of color overall, Native Americans and Latino men favored Trump. The implication is that a majority of Americans may still have concerns about a president being a woman, person of color, or both.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the presidential election was but one contest on a ballot of many decisions for voters. While former President Trump won a majority and the Electoral College, Democrats won statewide offices in the challenging states of Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nArizona’s constitutional right to abortion amendment passed overwhelmingly, as did Alaska’s minimum wage increase and sick leave requirement. The 2024 elections also yielded new African American female senators from Delaware and Maryland, and the first transgender representative and LGBTQ+ representative from the South. The point is that the election revealed the dynamism and range of American democracy, but also the continuing racial and gender criteria that inform how people decide their leadership.\n\n— David C. Wilson, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nKara Manke and Anne Brice contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Oil and Petroleum Products\n\nCarolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

        "content": "Baek Jae Gil, who adapted “Feliz Navidad” into a protest anthem, at a demonstration near the National Assembly in Seoul on Saturday.\n\nWhile calling for President Yoon Suk Yeol’s removal, tens of thousands of South Korean protesters have danced to traditional percussion, sung a pop genre called trot and blasted “Whiplash,” a hit by the girl group Aespa.\n\nThey’ve also left rallies with the melody of “Feliz Navidad” stuck in their heads. The adaptation’s repeated opening verse: “Impeachment is the answer.”\n\nThe day after Mr. Yoon’s short-lived declaration of martial law last week, the protest anthem’s creator, Baek Jae Gil, performed it for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul. A recording has received nine million views on X, and the song has spread on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. On the Chinese app WeChat, it has been translated into Chinese, he said.\n\n“If Yoon Suk Yeol gets lost, it’s a Merry Christmas,” the crowd sang along to the tune of the 1970 Christmas classic.\n\nMr. Baek, 52, a professional musician known as Baekja, has been protesting for decades. He has seen demonstrations become more peaceful and the mood lighten since his first rally in 1989. That was during a brutally suppressed teachers movement that led to the formation of a national union.\n\n“It was scary,” he said of those days in an interview last Saturday during protests at the National Assembly. “It was the time of tear gas and violent repression.”\n\nGrowing up as the youngest of six children in South Korea’s southwest, Mr. Baek said, he often heard stories from his older brothers about how soldiers suppressed pro-democracy protests in the nearby city of Gwangju in 1980, the last time South Korea was under martial law.\n\n“My brother was almost killed,” he said, adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses.\n\nIn middle school, he moved to Seoul at his brothers’ recommendation to find better opportunities. In high school, he wrote poetry, some of it political. He kept writing poems as he studied business at university, and a friend from high school turned them into songs.\n\nHe took the stage as a singer for the first time in 1990, the year he started college, at a pro-democracy protest on campus.\n\nMr. Baek also learned to play the guitar. In 1991, he performed it in the alleyways of Seoul among crowds of students and workers whose demonstrations were set off by the killing of a student activist. About a dozen protesters died setting themselves on fire.\n\n“I sang in the midst of tear gas every week,” he said.\n\nIn the past two decades, the police tactics to suppress demonstrations have become less violent. He said that protest culture changed significantly during candlelight vigils in 2002 in response to the deaths of two schoolgirls fatally struck by a U.S. Army vehicle. A U.S. military court acquitted two soldiers in the crash, sparking anger, but the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nMr. Baek also saw the mood at demonstrations become brighter after the protests against President Park Geun-hye, some of the largest the country has seen, led to her impeachment in 2016. People were jubilant, he said: A peaceful protest had toppled the country’s leader.\n\n“Protests in South Korea went from being dark and depressing to being fun and exciting,” Mr. Baek said. “There was a sense of pride in democracy.”\n\nThose demonstrations provided the inspiration for his “Feliz Navidad” adaptation. A protester performed a version of the song, originally written by the Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano, titled “Geun-hye Is Not the One.”\n\n(Mr. Feliciano did not comment directly on the latest adaptation. Susan Feliciano, his wife, said in a statement that the lyrics have been repurposed often and that it was gratifying to see the melody endure.)\n\nMr. Baek wrote his version in 2022, after Mr. Yoon had become president. Protests calling for his removal grew after a crowd crush in Seoul around Halloween killed more than 150 people. Mr. Baek wanted to come up with a song fit for the run-up to Christmas.\n\n“The response has been great,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s a Christmas carol.”\n\nMr. Baek has run into trouble with other satirical songs. A government-run broadcaster accused him of copyright infringement earlier this year after he used part of its footage in a YouTube video satirizing the material. At the broadcaster’s request, YouTube deleted his video, and the police launched an investigation. Mr. Baek said he was fighting the case, calling it a targeted infringement on his free speech rights.\n\nLast week, the day after hundreds of soldiers stormed the National Assembly, he sang his anthem and several other songs there to an energized audience that was younger than those he had seen at previous rallies.\n\n“Let’s make Yoon Suk Yeol’s arrest our Christmas gift this year!” he shouted before performing for a crowd of protesters.\n\nMr. Baek, who sang it again on a stage at last Saturday’s protests, said that he liked to lift people’s mood.\n\n“The wind is biting, isn’t it?” he told thousands of protesters as wind swept his brown-highlighted perm. “If you’re cold, get up and dance!”\n\nThe crowd rose and cheered.",

The command threatened violators will be arrested without warrant.\n\nLeaders of the ruling conservative People Power Party and the main liberal opposition Democratic Party both immediately decried Yoon's action as unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nTwo and a half hours after the announcement, 190 lawmakers gathered at the National Assembly amid armed soldiers swarming onto the legislature's premises. The lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon's party, annulled martial law in a unanimous vote.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in South Korea issued an alert, advising U.S. citizens to stay away from protests or other large gatherings, which could escalate into violence. The U.K. also made a similar travel advisory.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland\"\n\nIt was the first time martial law was imposed in South Korea since the 1980s. But in the early decades of the country's modern history, dictators and military juntas enforced martial law to squash political rivals and pro-democracy movements, often citing unsubstantiated threats from North Korea as the reason.\n\n\"And the South Korean people, they know their history as well,\" says Benjamin Engel, a visiting political science professor at Dankook University outside Seoul. \"And they're not going to accept a return of military rule or martial law. And that was clear from the get-go.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the chaotic and historic night, a growing crowd of protesters gathered outside the main gate of the parliament. Inside the compound, protesters and parliament staffers tried to block soldiers from entering the main meeting hall. Some built barricades with furniture.\n\nThe National Assembly's Secretary General Kim Min-ki said in a briefing that nearly 300 martial law troops stormed the parliament, flying in military helicopters or climbing over fences. Some smashed windows to enter the main building, he said. Kim announced that members of the defense ministry and the police will now be prohibited from entering the parliament, to protect the institution's functions and lawmakers' safety.\n\ntoggle caption Jung Yeon-Je/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, the main opposition Democratic Party has warned against the possibility that a conservative government can declare martial law to defuse a political crisis. Under President Park Geun-hye, daughter of the dictator Park Chung Hee, the military prepared a detailed plan for martial law amid nationwide protests over her corruption allegations that eventually led to her impeachment in 2017.\n\nDP's leader Lee Jae-myung openly raised a suspicion as recently as in September. Yoon's office brushed it off as \"irresponsible\" and \"brainwashing propaganda.\"\n\nNevertheless, after his suspicion became a reality, Lee expressed disbelief. \"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland, like I was in some cartoon,\" Lee said at a rally Wednesday afternoon. \"This country – the 10th biggest economy in the world, a cultural powerhouse and an aspiring 5th biggest military power – was backpedaling to an outdated country.\"\n\nLee said the Yoon administration resorted to physical force, cornered by a looming economic, security and political crisis.\n\n\n\nIntentions of martial-law declaration unclear\n\nYoon Suk Yeol is a former chief prosecutor who won the presidency as a political rookie in 2022 with a paper-thin margin.\n\nHe has struggled throughout his term with scandals involving him and his wife. His approval rating has dropped to 20% or below in recent weeks as allegations of Yoon and his wife Kim Keon-hee's involvement in an influence-peddling scandal emerged.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe DP has been pressuring Yoon over first lady Kim's acceptance of a luxury bag, alleged stock price manipulation, involvement in state affairs and other allegations. The opposition has also questioned Yoon's role in the alleged cover-up of a Marine's death last year and in the controversial relocation of the presidential office and residence.\n\nYoon has mostly denied or dismissed these accusations as political attacks and antagonized the opposition-led parliament, frequently blocking bills with veto power.\n\nEarlier this week, his government again clashed with the parliament, as the DP slashed large portions of Yoon's budget proposal for the next year.\n\nIt remains unclear what President Yoon expected to achieve with the martial law declaration.\n\nDankook University's Benjamin Engel says, \"There's no other real way to look at it except for a self-coup trying to extend his power\" and \"push through policies without any sort of negotiations or compromise with the opposition party.\"\n\ntoggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nPresident Yoon's future and legacy in doubt\n\nThe future of Yoon and his government appears grim. Yoon's senior aides and defense minister offered to resign. The DP is accusing the president, the defense minister and the interior minister for charges of insurrection.\n\nThe Korean Won and stock prices experienced large fluctuations amid uncertainties. Diplomatic and military schedules are being delayed, including a scheduled visit by the Swedish prime minister and a key nuclear deterrence meeting and exercise with the U.S.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said, \"The U.S. believes President Yoon's announcement to end martial law is a crucial step.\" The message stopped short of condemning martial law declaration.\n\nThe White House said it's relieved. But the politics professor Engel says Yoon's disruption of democratic system \"throws egg on the face of their whole trilateral cooperation efforts with the U.S., South Korea and Japan.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYoon has envisioned South Korea as a \"global pivotal state\" that promotes liberal democratic order and pursued \"value-based diplomacy\" with like-minded democracies.\n\n\"Yoon's legacy is gone,\" says Engel.",

        "content": "South Korean legislators have launched a push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, accusing him of declaring martial law in order to evade investigations into himself and his family.\n\nYoon’s declaration of martial law was swiftly overturned by lawmakers who tussled with troops before entering the National Assembly to vote it down early on Wednesday.\n\nOpposition legislators later filed a motion to impeach the president. It says the president “gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law” and accuses him of imposing martial law “with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations … into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family”.\n\nIn an early Thursday morning session, lawmakers presented the impeachment motion to parliament.\n\n“This is an unforgivable crime – one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,” MP Kim Seung-won said.\n\nYoon’s governing People Power Party said it would oppose the motion but the party has been divided over the crisis. The opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, needs at least eight governing party lawmakers to back the bill in order for it to pass.\n\nUnder South Korea’s constitution, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in the 300-member National Assembly. The Democratic Party currently holds 170 seats in parliament. A vote could take place as soon as Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the governing party on Wednesday slammed the incident and called for those involved to be held accountable.\n\n“The president must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation,” Han Dong-hoon told reporters in a televised broadcast.\n\nIf the National Assembly does agree to impeach, Yoon will be temporarily stripped of his presidential authority while the constitutional court considers his fate.\n\nSeveral senior officials have offered their resignations in the wake of the bungled events, including Presidential Chief of Staff Chung Jin-suk, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, and Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy Sung Tae-yoon.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo pledged to continue serving the people “until the last moment” and asked the cabinet to fulfil its responsibility together with the public officials of all ministries.\n\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the country’s largest labour organisations, had called for a strike until the president’s resignation.\n\nOverreach\n\nYoon announced he would lift the martial law order hours after the initial declaration on Tuesday.\n\nHe had said he was forced to issue the order “to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces” and accused the political opposition of “paralysing” his government and “undermining” the constitutional order.\n\nLawmakers then tussled with soldiers in order to enter parliament where they passed a legally binding motion forcing Yoon to reverse the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Democratic Party leader, Park Chan-dae, warned soon after the martial law order ended that Yoon “cannot avoid the charge of treason”.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, the president and CEO of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Al Jazeera that Article 77 of the South Korean Constitution stipulates that martial law may be declared when the country basically faces an existential threat.\n\n“It seems that this is a fairly frivolous exercise in declaring martial law,” he said.\n\nScarlatoiu noted that there may be some basis to Yoon’s assertion of a threat to national security. The Democratic Party, which holds the majority in parliament, has made it impossible for the executive branch to operate.\n\nYet, the fact that 190 members of parliament rejected martial law was a sign the president had overreached.",

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.\n\nYoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.\n\nActing chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”\n\nIf confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.\n\nThe now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.\n\nA former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.\n\nPark Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.\n\nHis administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.\n\nYoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.\n\nPolice raids and treason investigations\n\nIn his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.\n\nBut it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.\n\nDramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.\n\nSoldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.\n\nThe following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.\n\nLast week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.\n\nOn Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.\n\nSenior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.\n\nSpecial Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.\n\nSouth Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThen-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.\n\nCNN’s Lex Harvey, Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Billy Stockwell contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Protesters taking part in a rally calling for the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, near the National Assembly in Seoul, on Saturday.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters massed outside South Korea’s National Assembly on Saturday, calling for President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ouster as the lawmakers inside voted on whether to impeach him.\n\nBy the time Mr. Yoon had survived the impeachment motion, the crowd in Seoul had thinned out, but many said they would not give up.\n\n“I plan to come every weekend,” said Subin Park, 29. “I hope a lot of people will show up.”\n\nFor hours, the area around the National Assembly was packed with protesters calling for Mr. Yoon’s impeachment after his audacious, though short-lived, declaration of martial law late Tuesday plunged South Korea into political crisis.\n\nDemonstrations in the city and around the country have intensified through the week, and Saturday’s rally was the largest yet.\n\n“I am so angry. I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W.

        "content": "The stakes are high for President Yoon Suk-yeol as the opposition tries again to impeach him for declaring martial law.\n\nSeoul, South Korea – South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is set to face a second impeachment motion in the National Assembly on Saturday, just a week after a previous attempt by the political opposition fell short.\n\nThe stakes are high following Yoon’s controversial declaration of martial law on December 3, which triggered nationwide protests and heightened uncertainty for Asia’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nFor the latest impeachment motion to succeed, it must secure at least 200 votes – a two-thirds majority – in South Korea’s 300-seat National Assembly.\n\nThe opposition bloc holds 192 seats, leaving it eight votes short of the number required.\n\nHowever, in recent days, a small yet growing number of legislators from Yoon’s governing People Power Party have openly supported the motion, making impeachment increasingly more likely.\n\nIn a defiant televised address on Thursday, Yoon dismissed the idea of voluntary resignation, stressing, “Whether they impeach me or investigate me, I will stand firm.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens if Yoon is impeached?\n\nIf the National Assembly passes the impeachment motion, a series of legal and constitutional processes will unfold, starting with the official delivery of the impeachment resolution from the National Assembly to the President’s Office and the Constitutional Court.\n\nFrom that moment, Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended. He will still retain the title and some privileges associated with the presidency, including the presidential residence, and continued security protection.\n\nDuring this period, South Korea’s prime minister will assume the role of acting president under Article 71 of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the opposition is also considering impeaching Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in connection with his possible role in the martial law declaration. If Han is impeached, too, the deputy prime minister for the economy would take over as acting president.\n\nThe acting president will handle essential duties such as military command, issuing decrees, and managing state matters.\n\nWhile the Constitution does not clearly limit the scope of an acting president’s authority, precedent suggests powers should be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than initiating major policy changes.\n\nReview at the Constitutional Court\n\nThe impeachment process then moves to the Constitutional Court, where justices will review the case to determine whether Yoon’s removal is justified.\n\nAt least six out of the nine justices must support the motion for it to be upheld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, only six justices currently sit on the bench, meaning Yoon needs just one supportive ruling to survive the impeachment attempt.\n\nThe three vacant seats are positions that the National Assembly can nominate. While legislators are now rushing to fill those seats, the president has the final authority to approve the appointments, raising the possibility of delays or rejections.\n\nThe court is required to issue its decision within 180 days of receiving the case. The Constitutional Court took 63 days to rule on former President Roh Moo-hyun’s impeachment in 2004 and 91 days for former President Park Geun-hye’s case in 2016.\n\nYoon’s potential legal defence\n\nYoon’s speech on Thursday appeared to preview his defence strategy should the case reach the Constitutional Court.\n\nHe is likely to argue that declaring martial law was within his constitutional powers and did not constitute an illegal act or an insurrection.\n\nHe framed the martial law declaration as a “highly political decision” falling under the president’s powers, which are “not subject to judicial review”.\n\nYoon insisted that his decision was an “emergency appeal to the public” amid what he described as a severe political crisis, which he blamed on the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\n\nConstitutional Court’s ruling\n\nIf the court upholds the impeachment, Yoon will be removed from office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will lose privileges afforded to former presidents, such as pensions and personal aides, though he will continue to receive security protection.\n\nA presidential election must then be held within 60 days to elect a new leader.\n\nIf the impeachment is rejected, Yoon will be reinstated as president and resume his duties.\n\nSeparate investigations\n\nEven if he survives the second impeachment bid, Yoon still faces criminal investigations.\n\nAlthough a sitting president enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution, this protection does not extend to charges of insurrection.\n\nMultiple investigative agencies, including the police, the prosecution, and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, are investigating senior officials and military commanders on charges of insurrection.\n\nThis means that Yoon could potentially be arrested, which would mark the first such case involving a sitting president in South Korea.",

EMSC is reporting the same magnitude and depth, while the Thai Meteorological Department put the magnitude at 8.2. The quake was followed by a strong aftershock measuring M6.7 just 12 minutes later.\n\nThe epicenter was located 16 km (10 miles) NNW of Sagaing (population 78 739), 17 km (11 miles) WNW of Mandalay (population 1 208 099), and 55 km (34 miles) W of Pyon Oo Lwin (population 117 303), Myanmar.\n\n2 681 000 people are estimated to have felt violent shaking, 4 568 000 severe, 3 307 000 very strong and 13 716 000 strong.\n\nThe USGS issued a Red alert for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response.\n\nOverall, the population in this region resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist. The predominant vulnerable building types are informal (metal, timber, GI etc.) and unreinforced brick masonry construction.\n\nRecent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards, such as landslides, that might have contributed to losses.\n\nEstimated economic losses may exceed the GDP of Burma.\n\nLiquefaction triggered by this earthquake is estimated to be extensive in severity and (or) spatial extent. The number of people living near areas that could have produced liquefaction in this earthquake is extensive.\n\nLandslides triggered by this earthquake are estimated to be significant in number and (or) spatial extent.\n\nThis is the second M6+ earthquake of the day, following M6.1 near Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago at 00:34 UTC.\n\nThis is also the strongest earthquake so far this year, followed by M7.6 in Cayman Island on February 9 and M7.1 in Western Xizang, China on January 7.\n\nLe prime immagini dei danni provocati dal violento #terremoto di M 7.7 che pochi minuti fa è avvenuto in #Myanmar.

The National Unity Government of Myanmar reported the destruction or severe damage of at least 2 970 residential buildings, 150 religious structures, 30 roads, and 7 bridges.\n\nThe Islamic community estimated nearly 300 deaths occurred during prayer time as over 50 mosques collapsed across the country.\n\nMandalay was among the hardest-hit areas, with at least 674 confirmed deaths, 1 670 injuries, and over 1 000 people reported missing. More than half of the city’s buildings were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nNotable incidents here included the collapse of Mandalay University buildings, fires on campus, and the failure of the Dokhtawaddy Bridge along the Yangon–Mandalay Expressway, where some vehicles reportedly plunged into the river. Over 30 mosques were destroyed in the region, many of them historic, with heavy casualties reported.\n\nA monastery collapse left over 600 monks trapped, of which 80 were confirmed dead. Several buildings in Maha Aungmye and Pyigyidagun townships collapsed, trapping dozens. The Mandalay Palace, Mahamuni Pagoda, and a local dam also sustained serious damage, while parts of the Mandalay-Yangon highway buckled. Additional fatalities were reported in Yamethin, Kyaukse, Pyawbwe, Meiktila, and Bone Oe, with 36 deaths in Wundwin and destruction reported in Madaya Township.\n\nSagaing Township experienced widespread structural failure, with nearly 50 deaths, 300 injuries, and damage to around 80 percent of all buildings. The Ava Bridge partially collapsed, and four out of five mosques in Sagaing City were destroyed. Historic temples in Chaung-U Township, in the resistance-held southwest of the region, were also damaged.\n\nIn Naypyidaw, the capital, 204 fatalities were confirmed, including many civil servants killed when their residential buildings collapsed. The air traffic control tower at Naypyidaw International Airport collapsed, killing six people. The city experienced road damage, ceiling collapses, and structural failure in several government buildings, including the military headquarters and parliament facilities. The permanent secretary of the labor ministry and several senior foreign officials were among the casualties. The Defence Services Museum and the National Museum sustained significant damage. In Pyinmana, 86 bodies were recovered from the ruins of monasteries and residential structures.\n\nIn Shan State, at least 60 deaths were reported in Nyaungshwe Township, particularly in villages near Inle Lake. The village of Kayla, with over 1 000 households, saw 75 percent of its buildings destroyed. Significant damage was also reported in Zarat Gyi and Seong Wa Gyi. Many deaths were attributed to structural collapses or electrocution. In Aungban, a hotel collapse resulted in two deaths and 20 people trapped, while 16 others were injured. During the earthquake, jet fighters en route to a bombing campaign dropped ordnance on Nawnghkio Township, exacerbating the destruction.\n\nIn Bago Region, Taungoo Township reported the deaths of five children in a collapsed school and 14 fatalities in a mosque. A shelter used by displaced persons collapsed, trapping more than 20 people. In Pyu, a family of four died when their home’s wall collapsed.\n\nIn Yangon, the damage was relatively limited. Some buildings tilted, and there were temporary disruptions to phone lines, but no major casualties were reported. Overall, the full scale of the disaster remains unclear, particularly in rural areas where access remains limited.\n\nIn Thailand, at least 10 people were killed, 68 were injured, and 90 were reported missing.\n\nIn Bangkok, building swaying led to mass evacuations. All rapid transit lines were suspended for a day, and trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand was halted. Shaking was also felt in Chiang Mai and across most of the country.\n\nIn Bangkok’s Chatuchak district, a 30-storey government office building under construction collapsed, killing at least 8 people and trapping 79 people under rubble. Another collapse occurred at a luxury condominium construction site where a skybridge fell while hundreds of workers were inside the buildings. The full extent of casualties at that site remains unclear.\n\nThe reason why Thailand was affected so much lies in its soft marine clay top layer amplifying long-period ground motion, which can match the resonant frequency of tall buildings.\n\nHigh-rise building collapses due to strong 7.7M earthquake in Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/ZZUmvyQYWy — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nMoment of the 7.7 Magnitude powerful earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/KOLTBVS4ES — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nUpdates\n\n09:33 UTC, March 31\n\nThe death toll has jumped to more than 2 900 in Myanmar and to 18 in Thailand.

        "content": "An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has hit central Myanmar, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has said, with Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, among other areas affected. We take a look at the origins of the event and the scale of the disaster.\n\nWhat happened? According to the USGS, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Mandalay, Myanmar at 6.21am GMT. The quake is thought to have been shallow, arising at a depth of just 10km (6 miles), but the damage is expected to be enormous, with multiple buildings collapsed or damaged and reports of roads buckled and broken. The death toll is climbing, with fatalities reported in both Myanmar and Thailand. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said: “It is highly likely that build quality will generally not be high enough to survive this level of shaking, and casualty numbers will almost certainly climb significantly as more becomes known of the scale of the disaster.”\n\nWhat caused the earthquake? Earthquakes arise when huge slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, move against each other. According to USGS, the Myanmar quake occurred as the result of “strike slip faulting” between the India and Eurasia plates – meaning that these two tectonic plates rubbed sideways against each other. Map showing areas affected by earthquake “The quake happened on the Sagaing fault, which marks the tectonic plate boundary between the Indian plate to the west and the Eurasian plate to the east. The Indian plate is moving north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate,” said McGuire. The USGS says the region has experience several similar large strike slip earthquakes in the past, with six occurring within about 250km of the current earthquake since 1900 that were magnitude 7 or greater.\n\nWhat do these magnitude figures mean? While many people have heard of the Richter scale to measure the size of an earthquake, the current standard is the moment magnitude scale. “The Richter scale is an old scale developed for California. It is only good for smaller quakes, and is not very good at differentiating the sizes of bigger shocks,” said McGuire. As the USGS website notes, the moment magnitude calculation is based on the strength of the rock where the slip occurred, the area of the fault that slipped, and the distance the fault moved. “Thus, stronger rock material, or a larger area, or more movement in an earthquake, will all contribute to produce a larger magnitude,” it adds. However, like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that as the magnitude increases by one unit, the degree of ground shaking involved increases 10-fold. “This is a major quake by any standard, and its impact is made far worse by the fact that it was very shallow – only about 10km down. If it had been 100km deep, the impact would have been much smaller, so depth as well as size is critical,” said McGuire. But, he added, measurements do vary dependent on the locations of the seismic arrays used. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center the Myanmar earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China’s south-west Yunnan province.\n\nWill there be further quakes? “There has already been one large aftershock, and others can be expected in coming hours to days,” said McGuire. “These can bring down already weakened buildings and make the work of rescuers even more challenging.”",

There are obviously many, many people coming in with injuries,” he said.\n\nKumar added that he understands the Mandalay hospital is out of power and water. “Their capacity to be able to treat patients would be limited now, which is really sad,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile a seismologist told CNN that the powerful 7.7-magnitude quake that rocked Myanmar is like a “great knife cut into the Earth.”\n\nJames Jackson, from the University of Cambridge in England, said the earthquake was caused by a rupture that lasted for “a full minute,” causing sideways movements on the ground.\n\n“Think of a piece of paper tearing, and it tears at about two kilometers per second,” he said. “It’s moving a fault, which is like a great knife cut in the Earth.”\n\nHe said while Bangkok doesn’t have earthquakes, its tall buildings make the city particularly vulnerable to distant tremors.\n\nFabrice Cotton, a seismologist at the GFZ Center, told CNN that the earthquake was comparable in size to one that struck Turkey in 2023. More than 55,000 people are thought to have been killed in Turkey and Syria during that disaster.",

        "content": "Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government.\n\n“We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”\n\nMyanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority.\n\nWestern sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it.\n\nMichael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue.\n\nThere is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added.\n\nAnd, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said.\n\nWhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, little international aid reached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas.\n\nIn Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world.\n\nStefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas.\n\n“The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”\n\nAnother issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said.\n\nDr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

We will take time to bring the bodies out to avoid any further collapses,\" he told reporters, according to AFP\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Why was Friday's quake in Myanmar so damaging?\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: Sagaing has been hit by several quakes in recent years, with a 6.8 magnitude event causing at least 26 deaths and dozens of injuries in late 2012.\n\nBut Friday's event was \"probably the biggest\" to hit Myanmar's mainland in three-quarters of a century, Bill McGuire, an earthquake expert at UCL, told Reuters.\n\nRoger Musson, honorary research fellow at the British Geological Survey, told Reuters that the shallow depth of the quake meant the damage would be more severe. The quake's epicentre was at a depth of just 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\n\"This is very damaging because it has occurred at a shallow depth, so the shockwaves are not dissipated as they go from the focus of the earthquake up to the surface. The buildings received the full force of the shaking.\"\n\n\"It's important not to be focused on epicentres because the seismic waves don't radiate out from the epicentre - they radiate out from the whole line of the fault,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: UN mobilizing in southeast Asia, its chief says\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that the world body is mobilizing in Southeast Asia to help those in need after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar and Thailand.\n\n\"The government of Myanmar has asked for international support, and our team in Myanmar is already in contact in order to fully mobilize our resources in the region to support the people of Myanmar,\" Reuters quoted Guterres as saying.\n\n\"But of course, there are other countries impacted. The epicenter is in Myanmar, and Myanmar is the weakest country in this present situation,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: US agency analysis predicts thousands of deaths\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: A predictive analysis from a US agency based on the strength and depth of Friday's earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand estimated there could be thousands of deaths and severe economic loss, with Myanmar's Sagaing and Meiktila regions worst hit.\n\n\"Overall, the population in this region resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,\" the USGS analysis said.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: What junta chief said\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The death toll and the number of injuries are likely to rise, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said in a video speech on state broadcaster MRTV.\n\n“In some areas, buildings collapsed so rescue efforts are still under way,” he said. “As we carry out extensive rescue and relief efforts, I would like to request help.”\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: 144 dead, over 700 injured in Myanmar; junta chief calls for foreign aid\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: At least 144 people have been killed in Myanmar due to the massive earthquake that hit the country on Friday, the ruling junta chief said, reported AFP.\n\nThe chief, Min Aung Hlaing, also invited \"any country, any organisation\" to help with relief efforts and warned that the toll could go up in a speech aired on state media.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Monastery hit in Madalay\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The earthquake in Myanmar reportedly brought down multiple buildings in Mandalay, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery.\n\nA video shared on social media showed monks in the street shooting video of the multistory monastery before it suddenly fell to the ground.

[Sai Aung Main / AFP]\n\nA powerful earthquake rocked central Myanmar on Friday, sending strong tremors to neighboring regions, including southwestern China, as well as parts of South and Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to the China Earthquake Networks Center, the earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude.\n\nBy Friday night, 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in the powerful earthquake in Myanmar, the local government told Xinhua. Many more casualties are likely due to the collapse of housing and other facilities, according to local residents.\n\nThe earthquake took place at 2:20 pm (Beijing time), according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. The epicenter was monitored at 21.85 degrees north latitude and 95.95 degrees east longitude. The quake struck at a depth of 30 kilometers. The CENC said in a social media post that this was the strongest earthquake recorded so far this year.\n\nA magnitude-6.4 aftershock occurred just 12 minutes later.\n\nMyanmar's National Disaster Management Committee declared a state of emergency in six quake-affected areas and states, including Nay Pyi Daw, Sagaing region, Mandalay region, Magway region, northeast Shan state and Bago region, according to The Global New Light of Myanmar.\n\nStriking about 20 kilometers northeast of Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, the quake caused the collapse of the 90-year-old Old Sagaing Bridge, and several buildings in Mandalay and Nay Pyi Daw. Some sections of the expressway linking Mandalay and Yangon were also damaged, causing road closures along the route.\n\nThe strong earthquake also prompted the closure of Mandalay and Nay Pyi Daw airports, according to a statement by Myanmar Airways International on social media.\n\nPeople who got hurt during the earthquake were seen in crowds outside the emergency department at a major hospital in Nay Pyi Daw, according to AFP.\n\nA government spokesperson urged the international community to give humanitarian aid as soon as possible. The Myanmar Red Cross Society said it had begun to provide first-aid and other emergency response in earthquake-hit areas.\n\n\"This is the strongest earthquake I have ever experienced in my life,\" said Win Zaw Htay, a staff member of The Global New Light of Myanmar in Yangon, adding \"I tried to call some friends in Mandalay, but the line was busy so I could not reach them.\"\n\n\"The government is doing whatever possible (to help),\" said Aye Chan, chief editor of Myanmar Insider magazine, who believes the humanitarian organizations will help in their private capacity.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Myanmar said in a statement that Chinese nationals in Myanmar should remain on guard against earthquakes and secondary disasters. The embassy urged Chinese nationals to stay updated on earthquake and disaster prevention information and follow the arrangements and guidance of the local governments to relocate to safe areas.\n\nNeighboring Thailand declared a state of emergency in Bangkok.\n\nAnd two people were reported injured in Southwest China's Yunnan province.\n\nXinhua News Agency and Mekong News Network contributed to this story.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nAmericans don’t know the full extent of what Elon Musk is doing as he embeds alongside President Donald Trump at the top of the federal government.\n\nWhat we know is that he’s the world’s richest man, the president’s largest campaign benefactor, and a person whose companies have grown fat on government contracts, so he has a greater financial interest in how the government operates than your average naturalized immigrant.\n\nThere are clues\n\nWith that context in mind, consider this startling passage from a report by CNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Phil Mattingly and Tierney Sneed about a standoff between career officials at the Treasury Department and employees of DOGE, the Musk-allied Department of Government Efficiency, which has morphed after the election from the out-of-government advisory panel Trump talked about to a rebranded technology unit inside the White House complex. Mattingly, Polantz and Sneed write:\n\nThe top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, is leaving unexpectedly after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had asked about Treasury’s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk’s pushback was, “We don’t do that,” the person said.\n\n“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that’s unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau’s role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”\n\nMusk claims to be reclaiming government for you, the taxpaying voter\n\n“This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!” he wrote on the social media platform he owns, pushing people to rally at events opposing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund NGOs, nonprofits unaffiliated with the government that are supposed to do good works.\n\nThink Catholic Relief Services, the World Food Program and Save the Children. There can be a legitimate debate about whether the US should fund those programs in part because we know, thanks to transparency, that the US government is funding those programs.\n\nBut his method of taking over the bureaucracy is much less transparent than the bureaucracy itself.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton offered buyouts to federal workers, in 1993, for instance, he did so after getting buy-in from Congress. Trump’s administration is banking on a slim majority of Republicans in the House buying in to his plan, assuming they get a chance to have a say.\n\nMusk allies now in the government’s HR office\n\nThe New York Times and others reported this week that three former Musk employees have taken top positions at the Office of Personnel Management, the formerly obscure HR department for the federal government. It was OPM that first created a government-wide email system and then blasted it with an offer to millions of federal workers giving them the option to resign with pay until September. The offer caught federal workers off guard and unions and government watchdogs have said it is illegal.\n\nOPM confirmed to me that Amanda Scales, who used to work for Musk’s AI company xAI, is now chief of staff at OPM. Brian Bjelde, whose Linkedin profile still lists him as a SpaceX employee, is now a senior director, and so is Anthony Armstrong, a banker who worked with Musk to take over Twitter.\n\nThe New York Times report included other Musk allies in positions at other agencies, including the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate. Despite encouraging workers to return to the office, Musk also sees getting rid of government real estate or leases, and dispersing remaining workers throughout the country, as a cost saving technique.\n\nAre people getting fired next?\n\nTrump has twice referred to federal workers being fired if they’re not in offices after a February 6 deadline. “If they don’t agree by February 6 to show up back to work in their office, they will be terminated,” he said during a speech at the White House this week. There’s nothing in the resignation offer about people actively being fired in the near term.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Critics says Trump’s federal workforce buyout plan may not be legal 03:01 - Source: CNN Critics says Trump’s federal workforce buyout plan may not be legal 03:01\n\nMusk’s actual role is unclear\n\nWired reported he’s told friends he is sleeping at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds. CNN has not confirmed the report, although it is similar to the story he told about his early days at Twitter and Tesla, when he proved his devotion to employees by sleeping at the office or on the factory floor. It’s either the ultimate commitment to working from home or the ultimate commitment to his job.\n\nOne outstanding question: Has he taken an oath, like the federal workers he apparently has plans to fire, to uphold the Constitution?\n\nWhat are Musk’s conflicts of interest?\n\nI asked Walter Shaub, the former Director of the Office of Government Ethics, who has raised warnings about Trump but also criticized Democrats, about the opacity of Musk’s role and why it should concern Americans.\n\n“The Trump administration owes the American people a detailed explanation as to precisely how it hopes to manage conflicts of interest, as well as whether it deems Musk and each of the other participants in DOGE as a volunteer, a special government employee or a regular government employee,” he said in an email.\n\nPeople are supposed to know about the people who run their government\n\nThat’s why Trump’s nominees to lead agencies have to undergo nomination hearings on Capitol Hill and why top officials are supposed to file paperwork with the Office of Government Ethics disclosing their financial interests and pledging to act ethically.\n\nThey’re supposed to know how their government is spending money and who is doing the spending. The mass resignation offer that caught everyone off guard was made under authority granted to the OPM director. Trump’s nominee, the venture capitalist Scott Kupor, has not yet been confirmed, so the agency is operating with an acting director.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nMusk laid out some ideas in the Wall Street Journal, back in November when he was working with Vivek Ramaswamy, who has left DOGE.\n\nMass firings? That plan presaged an effort to encourage workers to resign. What comes next, according to that Journal plan, is they will “identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,” after which Trump could suspend worker protections to enforce a “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” One wonders how many air traffic controllers is the minimum number required.\n\nSteep spending cuts? They’re hoping to grab new power, with help from the Supreme Court, for the president to simply ignore Congress and not spend money, something called impoundment. They also wanted to cut $500 billion in spending by targeting things like public broadcasting and foreign aid. There’s already evidence of this plan in Trump’s since-rescinded order to halt federal grants.\n\nA hard look at Medicare? Some of the efforts should be welcome to Americans, like a long overdue examination of federal contracting and procurement. But don’t be surprised when it takes a hard look at Medicare spending, despite Trump’s pledge not to cut safety net spending. It’s all written out in the Journal.\n\nWhat’s not written is a public plan or a list of Musk allies now in the government. That is something everyone should want to take a look at.",

People involved in the operation say that secrecy and avoiding leaks is paramount, and much of its communication is conducted on Signal, the encrypted messaging app.\n\nMr. Trump has said the effort would drive “drastic change,” and that the entity would provide outside advice on how to cut wasteful spending. DOGE itself will have no power to cut spending — that authority rests with Congress. Instead, it is expected to provide recommendations for programs and other areas to cut.\n\nBut parts of the operation are becoming clear: Many of the executives involved are expecting to do six-month voluntary stints inside the federal government before returning to their high-paying jobs. Mr. Musk has said they will not be paid — a nonstarter for some originally interested tech executives — and have been asked by him to work 80-hour weeks. Some, including possibly Mr. Musk, will be so-called special government employees, a specific category of temporary workers who can only work for the federal government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period.\n\nThe representatives will largely be stationed inside federal agencies. After some consideration by top officials, DOGE itself is now unlikely to incorporate as an organized outside entity or nonprofit. Instead, it is likely to exist as more of a brand for an interlinked group of aspirational leaders who are on joint group chats and share a loyalty to Mr. Musk or Mr. Ramaswamy.\n\n“The cynics among us will say, ‘Oh, it’s naïve billionaires stepping into the fray.’ But the other side will say this is a service to the nation that we saw more typically around the founding of the nation,” said Trevor Traina, an entrepreneur who worked in the first Trump administration with associates who have considered joining DOGE.",

        "content": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sending representatives to agencies across the federal government, four people familiar with the matter said, to begin preliminary interviews that will shape the tech executives’ enormous ambitions to tame Washington’s sprawling bureaucracy. In recent days, aides with the nongovernmental “Department of Government Efficiency” tied to President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have spoken with staffers at more than a dozen federal agencies, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. The agencies include the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, the people said.\n\nAt the same time, Musk and Ramaswamy have significantly stepped up hiring for their new entity, with more than 50 staffers already working out of the offices of SpaceX, Musk’s rocket-building company, in downtown Washington, two of the people said. DOGE aims to have a staff of close to 100 people in place by Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile much about DOGE remains unclear — including who is paying the salaries of these staffers or exactly how DOGE representatives work with the formal transition team — the agency outreach reflects intensifying efforts by Musk and Ramaswamy to propose what they say will be “drastic” cuts to federal spending and regulations. Even as the scale of their project grows, Musk and Ramaswamy are encountering a slew of obstacles, including reluctance among congressional Republicans to approve deep budget cuts and a skeptical career civil service.\n\nTwo government employees said remarks Musk and Ramaswamy have made about the civil service have made them wary of the entire DOGE effort. Longtime civil servants — some who have built their careers learning the intricacies of the federal bureaucracy — are an awkward fit with Silicon Valley’s fast-moving and disruptive culture. Many in Washington regard the tech entrepreneurs as arrogant or naive about the complexity of reining in government.\n\nThe U.S. presidential transition process traditionally involves teams from the incoming administration working with existing agency staff and officials on the transfer of power, including regular briefings. This year’s changeover is far smoother than it was four years ago, when the process was complicated by Trump’s refusal to recognize the results of the election. But the uncertain status of DOGE relative to the rest of the Trump transition team has raised new questions about who precisely is speaking for the incoming administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a potential nod to the myriad challenges facing DOGE, Musk has begun tempering certain promises in his bid to achieve sweeping reform by reinventing the federal bureaucracy, eliminating entire agencies, shrinking the federal workforce and slashing historic sums from the federal budget. In an interview Wednesday night at CES, the tech trade show in Las Vegas, he said DOGE may fall short of his initial aim to cut $2 trillion in federal spending.\n\n“I think we’ll try for $2 trillion. I think that’s like the best-case outcome,” he said. “But I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting $1 [trillion].”\n\nThe idea of a commission to cut waste and regulation, long discussed among conservatives, was taken up by Musk and Trump during last year’s presidential election. Musk put $277 million toward electing Trump and other Republicans in 2024, and Trump has made the billionaire one of his most powerful advisers. After the election, Trump named Musk and Ramaswamy as DOGE’s co-leaders, assigned to identify government waste that the White House Office of Management and Budget would try to cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a project named as a joking reference to a meme-based cryptocurrency, DOGE has taken numerous steps since the election to build a very real Washington operation. Over the past several weeks, DOGE has been deluged by applications that have poured in through direct messages on X, Musk’s social media site, where the group put out a public call for “super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.”\n\nThat led to swarms of applicants who sought to bring their experience and credentials to the attention of Musk or Ramaswamy. In a blog post, Vinay Hiremath, co-founder of the tech company Loom, described four “intense and intoxicating” weeks of DOGE-related work after he became involved.\n\nAlthough he ultimately decided not to relocate to Washington for a job with DOGE, Hiremath said he had been added to multiple groups on the encrypted messaging app Signal, where DOGE is conducting much of its initial work. Hiremath did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crowdsourced callouts were followed by postings for more specific roles: Just after Christmas, DOGE said it was looking for IT, HR and financial staffers for full-time, salaried positions. This week, it put out a request for software engineers and information security engineers for full-time roles, advising applicants to send over “a few bullet points demonstrating exceptional ability” along with their cellphone numbers. On X, some users have listed their IQ scores in replies to Musk and DOGE and said they included them in their applications.\n\nKey leadership roles have also fallen into place. Steve Davis, the Boring Company president who oversaw steep cost-cutting at Twitter (now X) after Musk bought it, is helping to oversee the entire effort, and deputies have been recruited to focus on narrower aspects of its agenda, such as legislation and regulation, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nEmil Michael, a former Uber executive, is one of the people overseeing the effort to cut regulations, according to one person familiar with the matter, also speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect matters not yet made public. Trump has announced the appointment of Katie Miller, press secretary and communications director for former vice president Mike Pence, to DOGE. Trump also said in December that Bill McGinley, the former White House Cabinet secretary whom he’d previously named as White House counsel, would serve instead as DOGE counsel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how DOGE will drive change. The White House budget request applies to spending in fiscal 2026, which doesn’t begin until Oct. 1. Spending for the rest of the current fiscal year is being hashed out on Capitol Hill by congressional Republicans who already have voted overwhelmingly to boost spending for the Defense Department — an agency DOGE has vowed to target.\n\nNumerous party officials, meanwhile, are quietly wary of approving big spending cuts at the same time they are working to extend the expiring provisions of Trump’s 2017 tax legislation, which would reduce revenue by trillions of dollars. And it’s not clear how much weight Musk’s star power will carry on Capitol Hill, where federal spending is often prized for its benefits to hometown constituents. The limits of Musk’s influence were revealed in late December when Congress revised a stopgap spending bill he criticized but passed separate legislation to implement many of the specific provisions he lambasted.\n\nAs Musk’s emissaries begin to make contact with federal officials, critical questions remain unresolved about the group’s authority and responsibilities. The two federal employees expressed confusion about what DOGE is assigned to do — including whether it has Trump’s full backing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Every administration has to establish a relationship with its career people, because it’s the career people who keep the government going,” said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. “I think this is an important foray, but given what they have stated, it will be difficult for some career individuals to be cooperative with the DOGE people, who are not elected and are more advisers than political appointees.”",

Trump has taken issue with what he called “highly unfair” fees being charged for the use of the Panama Canal and told attendees of a Turning Point USA event in Phoenix the U.S. was being “ripped off.” The president-elect has also accused the Chinese military of illegally operating the Panama Canal, a pillar of maritime travel and trade.\n\n## Council Of Economic Advisers Chairman: Stephen Miran\n\nTrump tapped **Stephen Miran**, who served as a senior adviser for economic policy in the Treasury Department during Trump’s first term and is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute conservative think tank, to lead the three-member panel, though his appointment must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n## Ambassador To Italy: Tilman Fertitta\n\nTrump tapped **Tilman Fertitta**, owner of the Houston Rockets and the Texas-based restaurant and entertainment company Landry’s as ambassador to Italy.

He scored the GOP nomination after securing Trump’s endorsement, but he narrowly lost the general election to incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, after a scandal-filled campaign in which Walker was accused of threatening his ex-wife and paying a woman to get an abortion despite his staunch opposition to the procedure (which he denied). Walker’s relationship with the president-elect goes back to at least the 1980s, when he played for the New Jersey Generals, a short-lived United States Football League team bought by Trump. Decades later, Walker served on a presidential advisory board on fitness and nutrition during Trump’s first term, and he campaigned for Trump earlier this year.\n\n## Envoy For Special Missions: Ric Grenell\n\nFormer ambassador to Germany and fierce Trump ally **Ric Grenell** is his pick for the newly created position of envoy for special missions.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that her appointment would ensure that “the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.” The former news anchor and 2022 Arizona gubernatorial candidate has embraced Trump’s false claims about the 2020 elections being stolen. After losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs in the Governor’s race in 2022, she refused to concede and made multiple failed legal attempts to challenge the results. Responding to the announcement, Lake thanked Trump on X and said VOA is a “vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States.” Under her leadership, Lake said, VOA will “excel” at “chronicling America’s achievements worldwide.”\n\n## Undersecretary Of State For Economic Growth, Energy And The Environment: Jacob Helberg\n\n**Jacob Helberg **was appointed to serve as the State Department’s top economic policy and trade advisor.

Before his political career, Perdue served as a top executive at several companies including Reebok, Sara Lee and Dollar General, where he played a key role in outsourcing manufacturing to China, Hong Kong and other Asian countries. In a statement on X, Perdue wrote: “Having lived in Asia on two occasions, I understand the gravity of this responsibility and look forward to implementing President Trump’s strategy to make the world safe again and to represent the United States’ interests in China.”\n\n## U.s.

In his announcement on Truth Social, Trump said Bisignano is a business leader “with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations… [and] will be responsible to deliver on the Agency’s commitment to the American People.” In 2017, when he was the CEO of First Data Corporation—which was acquired by Fiserv in 2019, Bisignano placed second on the New York Times’ list of highest-paid CEOs in the country with a total compensation of $102.2 million (mostly in stock). Bisignano appears much lower on AFL-CIO's list of highest-paid CEOs for 2023, with a total pay of $27.9 million last year. Federal Election Commission filings show Bisignano’s wife, Tracy Bisignano, donated $924,600 to Trump’s campaign in October.\n\n## Small Business Administration Administrator: Kelly Loeffler\n\nFormer Sen. **Kelly Loefller, **R-Ga.,** **was nominated as administrator of the Small Business Administration by Trump, who said Loefller will crack down on “waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach” in her new role. The former senator fundraised for Trump ahead of the election, raising $7 million for his campaign this summer, according to CNN. As SBA administrator, Loefller will be in charge of overseeing billions of dollars worth of loans and disaster aid to small businesses. Loeffler’s run in the Senate was short-lived, as she filled in for a vacant seat left by former Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and served from 2020 to 2021, when she was defeated by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. Loeffler is the former CEO of a cryptocurrency platform known as Bakkt and is married to Jeffrey C.

Sheriff **Chad Chronister** was Trump’s initial choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency, but Chronister posted to X that he decided to withdraw. The post was met with accounts celebrating the withdrawal and ridiculing past decisions. But, the following day Trump took credit for Chronister stepping down, saying on Truth Social Chronister “didn’t pull out, I pulled him out.” Trump said he did so “because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.” As sheriff, Chronister once arrested a pastor for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules in 2020. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., posted to X after the announcement, saying he’s “glad to see [Chronister] withdraw from consideration. Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution.”\n\n## Senior Counselor For Trade And Manufacturing: Peter Navarro\n\nTrump chose **Peter Navarro** for the top trade advisor role, announcing the appointment on Truth Social and writing that Navarro “was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it,” referencing Navarro’s conviction last year that made him the first person in history to serve a prison sentence for contempt of Congress.\n\n## Nasa Administrator: Jared Isaacman\n\nTrump tapped billionaire **Jared Isaacman**, founder and CEO of Shift4 payment processing firm, as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, calling him “an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut” in a Truth Social post.\n\n## Army Secretary: Daniel Driscoll\n\nTrump announced **Daniel Driscoll**, a senior advisor to Vice President-elect JD Vance, will serve as the senior Defense department civilian.

In a Truth Social post, Trump called Stephens “one of the most successful businessmen in the Country.”\n\n## Senior Advisor On Arab And Middle Eastern Affairs: Massad Boulos\n\nTrump tapped **Massad Boulos**, father-in-law to his daughter, Tiffany Trump, as his senior advisor on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos’ son, Michael Boulos, married Tiffany Trump in 2022. Boulos, the CEO of a Nigerian motor vehicle company, conducted outreach to Arab American voters for Trump during his 2024 campaign.

Patel held multiple roles in the first Trump administration, including helping lead the GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into the FBI’s probe of Russia’s links to Trump’s 2016 campaign. He served as chief of staff to former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during Trump’s final months in office, and Trump reportedly attempted to install him as deputy CIA or FBI director in his final months in office, but reversed course amid internal backlash. Patel has remained fiercely loyal to Trump since he left office and has vowed to help Trump seek retribution against his various political enemies. He has also called for an overhaul of the FBI, writing in his book that the agency “has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken,” according to excerpts cited by ABC News. Patel would replace FBI Director Christopher Wray if he’s confirmed by the Senate.\n\n## Ambassador To France: Charles Kushner\n\nTrump nominated **Charles Kushner**, founder of the real estate firm Kushner Companies and the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared, as U.S. ambassador to France.

In announcing the appointment, Trump said “Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease.” In 2020, Bhattacharya co-authored an open letter titled the “Great Barrington Declaration” which argued against the effectiveness of Covid-19 lockdowns. The letter, which was criticized by health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, argued for “herd immunity” for most of the population “through natural infection” while sheltering vulnerable populations. According to his profile page on Stanford Medicine, the India-born Bhattacharya serves as professor of health policy at the university.\n\n## United States Trade Representative: Jamieson Greer\n\nWashington lawyer **Jamieson Greer** is Trump’s pick to lead international trade negotiations. An Air Force veteran and former chief of staff to Trump’s former trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, Greer “played a key role during my First Term in imposing Tariffs on China and others to combat unfair Trade practices,” Trump said in a statement.\n\n## National Economic Council Director: Kevin Hassett\n\nTrump picked **Kevin Hassett** to lead the National Economic Council, giving him significant sway over policy decisions surrounding trade, taxes and deregulation. Trump said Hassett “will play an important role in helping American families recover from the Inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration.” Hassett, who led the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s first term, recently expressed some skepticism about some of Trump’s economic proposals, telling Goldman Sachs last month Trump’s proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% was unlikely to net the same “dynamic effects” as the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and Trump’s tariffs proposals would likely require legislation, Politico reported. Hassett also told Goldman that Federal Reserve leadership should be “neutral” from the administration and said “suspicions” about Trump’s desire for coordination between the Fed and the White House in setting interest rates “should be taken seriously.”\n\n## Domestic Policy Council Director: Vince Haley\n\n**Vince Haley, **who served as adviser and speechwriter during Trump’s first term was named as the head of the Domestic Policy Council. Trump said Haley had a “brilliant mind for Policies that work for the American People.” Trump did not outline any specific issues that Haley will focus on, but according to the Wall Street Journal the council will oversee several key domestic issues, including “healthcare, immigration and education.” Haley has worked with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., for several decades and even served as the campaign manager of his 2012 presidential bid. Haley also worked under Stephen Miller—who Trump named as his Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy— while writing Trump’s speeches during his first term in office.\n\n## Department Of Health And Human Services Deputy Secretary: Jim O’neill\n\nSilicon Valley investor **Jim O’Neill**, who is a close associate of billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel, was named as the pick for the Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary. In his announcement Trump said O’Neill will work alongside his HHS Secretary pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and “oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again.” O’Neill previously served as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation and was up for consideration for the FDA commissioner role during Trump’s first term. O’Neill also worked as the HHS principal associate deputy secretary during the George W. Bush administration. The Silicon Valley investor has called for major reform at the FDA in the past and argued that the efficacy of drugs should be measured after they have been allowed on market. O’Neill said the agency should approve drugs once its been demonstrated as being safe.\n\n## Navy Secretary: John Phelan\n\nTrump tapped financier **John Phelan** as his nominee for Secretary of the Navy. Phelan founded MSD Capital more than two and half decades ago to manage the fortune of billionaire Michael Dell. According to the Hill, Phelan was a key donor to Trump’s campaign during this election season and contributed $834,600 to the president-elect’s joint fundraising committee, Trump 47.\n\n## Treasury Secretary: Scott Bessent\n\nHedge fund executive **Scott Bessent** is Trump’s pick for treasury secretary. Bessent—who spoke recently with Forbes—had long been seen as a top choice for the role, especially as it was reported Trump was leaning toward someone with Wall Street experience. Bessent is the founder of Key Square Management, a hedge fund that had less than $600 million in assets under management at the end of last year, and worked for Democratic megadonor George Soros for years before that. Bessent donated about $3 million to Trump and other Republican causes this election season and previously said Trump was “very sophisticated on economic policy.” Bessent is known for being pro-tariff—tariffs are at the center of Trump’s economic policies—and called the import taxes a “negotiating tool with our trading partners” in a Fox News column. If confirmed, Bessent would make history as the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ+ Republican Cabinet member.\n\n## Attorney General: Pam Bondi\n\nTrump announced former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his pick to lead the Justice Department—elevating an ally shortly after former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s withdrawal. Bondi served as Florida’s top lawyer from 2011 to 2019, and later joined Trump’s defense team in his first Senate impeachment trial in 2020. She also served on a Trump-era commission on opioids and drug addiction. Attorney general is one of the most high-profile and highly anticipated appointments, as Trump has fiercely criticized the Justice Department for prosecuting him and is expected to drastically change its makeup—and possibly push for retribution against his opponents. In a Truth Social post, Trump said Bondi will “refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.”\n\n## Secretary Of Defense: Pete Hegseth\n\nTrump selected **Pete Hegseth** as his secretary of defense, praising his status as a combat veteran and role as a co-host on Fox & Friends Weekend. Revelations subsequently emerged that Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. The Monterey Police Department confirmed in a statement that it investigated the incident, but did not bring charges. Hegseth has denied the allegations through his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, who told multiple outlets he paid his accuser a settlement to avoid a lawsuit over the matter.\n\n## Health And Human Services Secretary: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump nominated **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** to lead the Health and Human Services Department, making good on his promise to give Kennedy broad leeway over public health. Kennedy, who ran for the Democratic nomination then as an independent candidate before dropping out and endorsing Trump, espouses debunked views on public health—including skepticism about the efficacy of childhood vaccines and the Covid-19 vaccine. He has also advocated for removing fluoride from public water, an idea Trump said he as open to. As HHS secretary, Kennedy would oversee 13 public health-related agencies, and has expressed plans to upend many of them, telling an audience at a conference in November he would halt infectious disease studies at the National Institutes of Health if given a role in the Trump administration. “I’m going to say to NIH scientists, God bless you all . . . thank you for your public service,” NBC reported. The surprise selection drew criticism from many Democrats, and some Republicans expressed wariness about the pick. Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence spoke against Kennedy as the pick to lead HHS in a statement and urged Senate Republicans to reject the nomination, citing Kennedy’s support of abortion rights.\n\n## Secretary Of State: Marco Rubio\n\nTrump nominated Sen. **Marco Rubio**, R-Fla., as secretary of state. Rubio and Trump feuded when they both ran for president in 2016, but the two smoothed over their relationship during Trump’s most recent White House run. Rubio frequently campaigned for Trump and was said to be in the running to be his vice presidential pick. Some of Rubio’s foreign policy stances break with Trump, including his co-sponsorship of legislation last year that would prohibit a president from exiting NATO without congressional approval. Rubio would be the first Latino to hold the position, which is subject to Senate confirmation. Forbes estimated Rubio’s net worth at over $1 million—significantly less than some other members of Trump’s inner circle, but a jump since 2015, when he was worth just $100,000.\n\n## Director Of National Intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard\n\nTrump announced **Tulsi Gabbard** will serve as his Director of National Intelligence, a role that puts her at the head of the U.S. intelligence community. Gabbard is a former Democratic representative from Hawaii and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, perhaps best-known for clashing with Kamala Harris on the debate stage in 2019. She left the party in 2022 and became an independent, before endorsing Trump in August and announcing she had joined the Republican Party. A critic of U.S. military interventions, Gabbard has drawn intense scrutiny for her foreign policy views, including for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017.\n\n## Education Secretary: Linda Mcmahon\n\nTrump tapped former WWE CEO **Linda McMahon** as secretary of the Department of Education. McMahon is Trump’s transition co-chair alongside Lutnick and served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. The nomination came after Lutnick was picked as commerce secretary over McMahon, who was “privately frustrated” she was not offered the position before Lutnick was tapped for it, Semafor reported, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. McMahon is also the America First Policy Institute’s board chair, helping lead the think tank that has raised millions in support of Trump, according to CNN.\n\n## Commerce Secretary: Howard Lutnick\n\n**Howard Lutnick** is Trump’s pick for commerce secretary—choosing him for the commerce role instead of treasury secretary. Trump, in a statement, called Lutnick “the embodiment of resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy,” referencing his charitable contributions to 9/11 families after 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees, including Lutnick’s brother, died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while Lutnick was CEO. Lutnick, who rebuilt the company after 9/11, has spent his entire career at Cantor Fitzgerald and became president and CEO of the financial services firm at the age of 29. His special purposes acquisition company, Cantor Fitzgerald Acquisition Corp., took the Rumble video platform popular among right-wing influencers public in 2022. As commerce secretary, Lutnick will play a role in implementing Trump’s plans for steeper tariffs and he has expressed broad support for the proposal. Lutnick was previously under consideration for treasury secretary—typically a more prominent Cabinet job—and earned support from Musk and Kennedy, but Trump ultimately turned his attention to other candidates after he reportedly became annoyed with Lutnick’s aggressive campaign for the treasury role.\n\n## Homeland Security Secretary: Kristi Noem\n\nTrump picked South Dakota Gov. **Kristi Noem** for the role of secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem is a long-time Trump loyalist who was believed be a contender for Vice President. The appointee will be essential in carrying out Trump’s aggressive immigration plans, in addition to the agency’s duties surrounding cybersecurity, antiterrorism and emergency response.\n\n## Agriculture Secretary: Brooke Rollins\n\nTrump announced **Brooke Rollins **as his pick for agriculture secretary. Rollins served as a policy advisor during Trump’s first administration and is the president of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank founded by former Trump administration officials that has advocated against foreign ownership of U.S. farmland. She was reportedly considered for White House chief of staff before Susie Wiles was named to the role.\n\n## Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services Administrator: Mehmet Oz\n\n**Mehmet Oz**, the celebrity doctor who lost his 2022 Senate bid to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., will fill the role. Oz will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump announced as his pick for Health and Human Services secretary. Oz’s rise to fame is largely tied to his frequent appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show in the early 2000s and his own subsequent daytime talk show. He’s accused of espousing questionable medical claims, including promoting the debunked theory that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19, and pushing so-called miracle weight loss products unsupported by scientific research. Trump endorsed Oz in his 2022 Senate campaign.\n\n## Chief Of Staff: Susie Wiles\n\nTrump named his campaign co-manager **Susie Wiles** chief of staff two days after his election win, marking his first major administrative pick. Wiles will be the first woman to hold the position.\n\n## Department Of Government Efficiency: Elon Musk And Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nTrump announced **Elon Musk**, the world’s wealthiest person, will run a new Department of Government Efficiency (or “DOGE”) alongside investor and former Republican primary candidate **Vivek Ramaswamy**. Trump said in a statement the department—which has not yet been created—will offer “advice and guidance from outside of Government” and focus on “making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency,” including through spending and regulatory cuts. Musk, a vocal Trump backer who donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, has pitched the department in the past, seemingly naming it after the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin.\n\n## Office Of Management And Budget Director: Russell Vought\n\nTrump nominated **Russell Vought** as director of the Office of Budget and Management, potentially marking his second time in the role. Vought was the office’s director from 2020 to 2021 after serving as deputy director and acting director. Vought authored a chapter in the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda on the Executive Office of the President of the United States and will be in charge of overseeing the White House budget and implementation of Trump’s policies throughout the executive branch. He also reportedly said in secret camera footage published by the Centre for Climate Reporting that Trump “blessed” Project 2025 despite distancing himself from it on the campaign trail. Vought is expected to push for policy restructuring that provides more power to the president.\n\n## Homeland Security Adviser And Deputy Chief Of Staff For Policy: Stephen Miller\n\nTrump announced **Stephen Miller **as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, plus the additional role of homeland security adviser. Miller was a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and one of the architects of some of his most controversial immigration policies, including his family separation program.\n\n## Border Czar: Tom Homan\n\nTrump appointed his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director **Tom Homan** to newly created role, he announced, as Trump plans a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his second term.\n\n## Cdc Director: Dave Weldon, Fda Commissioner: Marty Makary, Surgeon General: Janette Nesheiwat\n\nTrump announced former Rep. **Dave Weldon**, R-Fla.—who served in Congress from 1995 to 2009—as CDC director, and tapped **Marty Makary**, who became known for opposing vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, as FDA commissioner. He also named former Fox News contributor **Janette Nesheiwat** as his pick for surgeon general.\n\n## Secretary Of Labor: Lori Chavez-Deremer\n\nRep. **Lori Chavez-DeRemer**, R-Ore., was nominated as Trump’s secretary of labor. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 to represent Oregon’s 5th Congressional District and recently lost her reelection bid.\n\n## Senior Director For Counterterrorism: Sebastian Gorka\n\n**Sebastian Gorka** was appointed as the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism. He previously served as strategist to the president in the first Trump administration and is the host of his own radio show, “America First with Sebastian Gorka.”\n\n## Hud Secretary: Scott Turner\n\nTrump named former NFL player **Scott Turner** as his pick for secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Turner served in the first Trump administration as the executive director of Trump’s White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.\n\n## National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz\n\nTrump appointed Rep. **Mike Waltz**, R-Fla., to serve as his national security adviser. In recent months, Waltz—a former Army Green Beret—has frequently criticized China, urged NATO members to pay more for defense and said he expects Trump to push Ukraine and Russia toward a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n## Interior Secretary: Doug Burgum (and Head Of New National Energy Council)\n\nTrump nominated North Dakota Gov. **Doug Burgum** as secretary of the interior. If confirmed by the Senate, he’ll be responsible for managing vast swaths of federally owned land, administering national parks and handling oil and gas drilling on federal property—which Trump has vowed to ramp up. Trump also tapped Burgum as chairman of the new National Energy Council, which will cut down on regulations and “oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE,” according to Trump. The position will also provide Burgum a seat on the National Security Council. First elected North Dakota governor in 2016, Burgum briefly ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries, but dropped out and endorsed Trump. A tech executive and investor by trade, Burgum previously ran Great Plains Software, remaining at the company after it was acquired by Microsoft. Last year, Forbes estimated his net worth at at least $100 million.\n\n## Energy Secretary: Chris Wright\n\n**Chris Wright**, chief executive of the oilfield services group Liberty Energy, was named Trump’s nominee for secretary of energy. Wright has argued against climate change’s role in causing extreme weather events, saying in a video posted to LinkedIn last year “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” He later disputed he was “[fighting] climate science,” despite saying the claims he made were “correct.”\n\n## Transportation Secretary: Sean Duffy\n\nTrump nominated former Rep. **Sean Duffy**, R-Wisc., as secretary of transportation, lauding his time in Congress and his role as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Following his resignation from Congress in 2019, Duffy registered as a lobbyist and continued spending campaign funds on Trump’s D.C. hotel. The campaign spent more than $22,000 at Trump’s D.C. hotel between 2017 and 2020, $17,000 of which was spent in a single day in July 2019. Duffy is a co-host of Fox Business’ “The Bottom Line” and has contributed to Fox News since 2020. He is married to “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\n## Veterans Affairs Secretary: Doug Collins\n\nTrump picked former Rep. **Doug Collins**, R-Ga., as his secretary for veterans affairs. Collins served as a congressman from 2013 to 2021, and was known as a vocal backer of Trump in the chamber during his first administration. He is also a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command. Collins vowed to “streamline and cut regulations in the VA, root out corruption, and ensure every veteran receives the benefits they've earned.” The former congressman was deployed to Iraq in 2008 as a member of the Air Force’s 94th Airlift Wing.\n\n## Cia Director: John Ratlciffe\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence **John Ratcliffe** will serve as CIA director. A former Texas congressman, Ratcliffe served as the director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021 and acted as Trump’s primary intelligence adviser during his last presidency. During his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe declassified unverified Russian intelligence information that claimed Hillary Clinton approved a plan to link Trump to Russia and the Democratic National Committee cyberattacks in 2016. Democrats criticized Ratcliffe’s decision to publicly release the information, alleging he was politicizing unverified information to aid Trump.\n\n## Environmental Protection Agency Administrator: Lee Zeldin\n\nTrump tapped former Rep. **Lee Zeldin**, R-N.Y., to lead the EPA, citing his “very strong legal background” and calling him “a true fighter for America First policies” in a statement. Zeldin—a Trump ally who ran for New York governor two years ago—“will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American business while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards,” the statement said.\n\n## Fcc Chair: Brendan Carr\n\nTrump named **Brendan Carr** to chair the Federal Communications Commission. Carr has served as one of the FCC’s five commissioners since 2017, when Trump first appointed him to the agency. He’s known as a critic of big tech companies, writing a chapter of the controversial Project 2025 agenda—which Trump has broadly disavowed—that argued the FCC should narrow the immunity enjoyed by tech platforms and require companies to be transparent about their content moderation decisions. He’s also used his platform at the FCC to back Musk. He’ll take over the FCC as Trump pushes the agency to revoke the licenses of broadcast TV stations whose coverage he claims is unfair—though that could be very difficult in practice.\n\n## Ambassador To Un: Elise Stefanik\n\nTrump nominated GOP Conference Chair Rep. **Elise Stefanik**, R-N.Y., for the United Nations ambassador role. Stefanik is known as a staunch Trump ally.\n\n## Special Envoy To The Middle East: Steven C. Witkoff\n\nTrump tapped** Steven Witkoff**, a GOP donor and real estate investor, for special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is chairman of the University of Miami Business School Real Estate Advisory Board and the CEO of Witkoff, a real estate firm he founded in 1997. He is also a longtime friend of Trump’s and one of the president-elect’s golf partners. Witkoff was with Trump during the apparent second assassination attempt on his life, telling NBC that Secret Service agents dived on Trump and got him off his Florida golf course in under 20 seconds.\n\n## Ambassador To Nato: Matthew Whitaker\n\nTrump announced **Matthew Whitaker** will serve as the official U.S. representative to NATO. Whitaker was the former U.S. acting attorney general appointed after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned and before former Attorney General William Barr was sworn in during Trump’s first term. Whitaker oversaw the DOJ during former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was heavily scrutinized by Democrats over whether he sought to interfere in the probe on Trump’s behalf, allegations he denied. Whitaker frequently appears on Fox News as an advocate for Trump, defending his decision to tap Gaetz as attorney general and broadly criticizing the Justice Department over its various investigations into Trump’s conduct.\n\n## Ambassador To Israel: Mike Huckabee\n\nTrump announced former Arkansas Gov. **Mike Huckabee** as his envoy to Israel, touting his military service as he served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years. Huckabee is a staunch supporter of Israel and has criticized the Biden administration’s calls for a cease-fire with Hamas. Huckabee has advocated for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank, which Israel occupied in 1967, and has backed Israeli settlers in the territory. A former Southern Baptist pastor, Huckabee regularly leads evangelicals on visits to Israel.\n\n## White House Press Secretary: Karoline Leavitt\n\n**Karoline Leavitt**, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, will serve as White House Press Secretary once the president-elect assumes his office. Leavitt, 27, was an assistant press secretary during Trump’s first presidency. She also won the Republican primary in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in 2022, becoming the second Gen Z candidate to win a House primary.\n\n## White House Communications Director: Steven Cheung\n\nTrump picked his campaign spokesman, **Steven Cheung**, to serve as his communications director at the White House. Cheung was the director of communications for the president-elect’s 2024 presidential campaign and served as director of strategic response during Trump’s last term, after working in communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship previously.\n\n## Other White House Jobs\n\n- Trump named\n**James Braid**his director of legislative affairs—Braid is Vice President-elect Sen. JD Vance’s lead policy staffer and worked in the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term. **Matt Brasseaux**, a deputy political director for the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee in 2024, was appointed director of the office of political affairs.**Alex Latcham**, Trump’s former deputy political director during his first administration and a senior deputy political director for his most recent campaign and the RNC, will serve as director of the office of public liaison.- Campaign staffer and former One America News anchor\n**Natalie Harp**—nicknamed the “human printer” as she’s known for trailing Trump with a portable printer and supplying him with paper copies of news stories—is expected to help control the flow of information to and from Trump, according to The New York Times, though she hasn’t officially been given a role. - Top GOP lawyer\n**William McGinley**was chosen for White House counsel, after previously working as Trump’s White House cabinet secretary from 2017 to 2019, advising other cabinet members on policy coordination, optics and ethics. **Dan Scavino**will return to his role as deputy chief of staff, after serving as a longtime Trump communications staffer (he was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in the House Jan. 6 committee investigation, but the Justice Department declined to prosecute him).**James Blair**will work as deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs, after spearheading Trump’s grassroots voter outreach efforts and making frequent media appearances.**Taylor Budowich**was picked for deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, after running the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. super PAC.- Trump tapped\n**William Scharf**to be White House staff secretary: Scharf, a former prosecutor who ran in the Republican primary for Missouri attorney general, was part of Trump’s legal team that successfully argued he has immunity from official acts he took during his first term. **Sergio Gor**, president and co-founder of Donald Trump Jr.’s Winning Team Publishing company, has been tapped to lead the Presidential Personnel Office.\n\n## Other Justice Department Jobs\n\n**Joseph Nocella Jr.**, a Nassau County District Court Judge, was tapped as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, one of the most high-profile districts in the country spanning Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Long Island. Nocella will replace Biden appointee Breon Peace, who is stepping down later this month.**Todd Blanche**, Trump’s hush money trial lawyer, was tapped as the president-elect’s deputy attorney general. Blanche was lauded as “an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department,” which Trump has often criticized throughout his criminal and civil cases.- Trump picked another of his attorneys,\n**Emil Bove**, as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove represented Trump alongside Blanche throughout the hush money trial and is a former federal prosecutor. **Dean John Sauer**was chosen for for solicitor general, after he was credited with helping win Trump’s presidential immunity case, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have some immunity for official acts they take in office. Sauer also served as solicitor general of Missouri for six years and clerked for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman\n**Jay Clayton**was chosen as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, widely seen as one of the most prestigious prosecuting jobs due to the high-profile cases filed in the district, which includes New York City.\n\n## Tangent\n\nTrump asked Republican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley to return to his role. Trump tapped Whatley and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to co-chair the RNC after he effectively secured the GOP 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n## Key Background\n\nTrump decamped to Mar-a-Lago after his win, holding meetings with his inner circle, administration hopefuls and transition team to craft his second term agenda and build out his staff. Trump is shaping his second-term agenda with the help of several right-wing groups, his closest allies and billionaire backers. Musk, who has been spotted on numerous occasions alongside Trump since his election, is among those who appear to be influencing Trump’s policy and personnel decisions. Lutnick is also overseeing a team making recommendations for personnel picks and vetting potential candidates, and Miller is expected to play a key role in making the final decisions. The right-wing think tank America First Policy Institute is reportedly the primary driver of Trump’s transition plans and has been crafting possible executive actions for Trump once he takes office. The organization is chaired by McMahon and led by former Trump Domestic Policy Counsel Director Brook Rollins.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nWho Will Help Shape Trump’s Policy Agenda?

He's extremely, doggedly active on social media. He'll have a cost-cutting role in Donald Trump's administration when the president-elect is sworn in later this month.\n\nAnd he's frequently bashing international governments whose politics he dislikes and praising far-right figures.\n\nTechnology mogul Elon Musk has been using his X social media platform in recent weeks to unleash a torrent of criticisms and accusations aimed at political figures in Britain, Germany and Canada.\n\nThough he did not mention him by name, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a news conference on Monday in response to a reporter's question that Musk and others like him who disseminate false information online had gone too far. Starmer pushed back on them for \"spreading lies\" that amounted to the \"poison of the far right.\" He said those doing so \"were not interested in victims.\"\n\nMusk has been appointed by Trump along with Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk was a major donor to Trump's presidential campaign. The two have been spending a lot of time together including at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach, Fla. residence.\n\nWhat's Elon Musk been saying?\n\nIn Britain, Musk has called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a far-right extremist who was jailed for 18 months in October for repeating a libelous claim about a Syrian refugee schoolboy attacking girls.\n\nMusk has said \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.\" He's accused Starmer of failing to bring to justice \"rape gangs\" connected to a series of cases from a decade ago when groups of men in towns in northern England, most from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. Some men received lengthy jail sentences in connection with their crimes. Britain's previous Conservative government held an inquiry to establish how the episodes were allowed to happen, but many of its 2022 recommendations have yet to be implemented.\n\nIn Germany, Musk has said that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is openly critical of Islam, has been accused of Holocaust minimization and opposes mass immigration, is the only one that can \"save\" the country. He's said Germany is \"on the brink of economic and cultural collapse\" and that many Germans feel their concerns are \"ignored by the establishment.\"\n\nMusk on Brazil: X will come back online in Brazil after Elon Musk backs down from legal fight\n\nIn Canada, Musk has called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his intention to resign on Monday, an \"insufferable fool\" after he characterized Kamala Harris’ U.S. presidential loss to Trump as a setback for women’s progress. He's praised Canadian political firebrand Pierre Poilievre, a Trump-inspired populist who's railed against government bureaucracy and inefficiencies and claimed that a climate change-related carbon tax in Canada would lead to \"mass hunger and malnutrition.\"\n\nWhat is Musk trying to achieve?\n\nMusk's supporters say he's doing what others, particularly in the media, are failing to do.\n\nHe's \"highlighting the truth, asking who was responsible for this grotesque failure, and asking why politicians are not doing more,\" Matt Goodwin, a right-wing British political commentator who researches populist political movements, wrote in an email newsletter Sunday, referring to the grooming cases in northern England from a decade ago.\n\nGoodwin's newsletter was titled, \"Elon Musk isn't the problem; legacy media is the problem.\"\n\nRiots in the UK spurred by racist posts: Experts warn of a repeat in the US\n\nMusk's detractors say he appears to be doing what he did in the U.S. when he used his influence to help elect Trump: promoting extreme political figures like Robinson and wading into controversial spaces where he may not have a grasp of the detail or sense of the bigger picture. An independent, damming report published in 2022 in Britain found that local police and officials missed numerous opportunities to prevent abuse in the grooming cases stretching back to 2005.\n\n\"Elon Musk is an American citizen and perhaps ought to focus on issues on the other side of the Atlantic,” Andrew Gwynne, a health minister in Starmer's Labour Party government said during a Friday in a British radio interview.\n\n“Had Elon Musk really paid attention to what’s been going on in this country, he might have recognized that there’ve already been inquiries,” Gwynne noted.\n\nIn recent days, Musk has also appeared to change his mind about Nigel Farage, saying the leader of the right-wing Reform UK \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the political party. Farage is a close Trump ally. Musk appears have soured on Farage because the latter does not back Musk's support for Robinson, the jailed far-right activist.\n\nWhat's next for Musk on the world stage?\n\nMusk is poised to hold a live X discussion with Alice Weidel, who is running to be chancellor in Germany's snap election on Feb. 23. That conversation could happen as early as this week.\n\nWeidel is the chair of the AfD party, which is being monitored by German authorities for being a suspected extremist organization. Its leaders have been accused of xenophobia, antisemitism and the party campaigns on an aggressive anti-immigration platform. AfD is polling at about 20% nationally, in second place behind the Christian Democratic Union party, at 30%. The CDU is a center-right, conservative party.\n\nMusk did something similar − an interview on X − with Trump last year on the campaign trail when a series of questionable and false claims about global warming, immigration and inflation went largely unchallenged. In the interview, which was beset by technical glitches, Trump denounced criminal cases and lawsuits against him without any skepticism from Musk, who at one point attacked \"abuse of the legal system.\"\n\nMalfunction junction: Elon Musk chats up Donald Trump amid X tech glitches\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron and Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store added their voices to the growing chorus of European leaders who appeared troubled by Musk's X posts.\n\n\"Ten years ago, who would have imagined that the owner of one of the world’s largest social networks would be supporting a new international reactionary movement and intervening directly in elections, including in Germany,\" Macron on Monday. “I find it worrying that a man with enormous access to social media and huge economic resources involves himself so directly in the internal affairs of other countries,” said Store.\n\nMusk did not respond to a question posed to him on his X platform about the pushback to his comments he has been receiving from European political figures.",

Brandon Bell | Via Reuters\n\nThe U.S. political landscape is set to undergo some shifts in 2025 — and those changes will have some major implications for the regulation of artificial intelligence. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Joining him in the White House will be a raft of top advisors from the world of business — including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — who are expected to influence policy thinking around nascent technologies such as AI and cryptocurrencies. Across the Atlantic, a tale of two jurisdictions has emerged, with the U.K. and European Union diverging in regulatory thinking. While the EU has taken more of a heavy hand with the Silicon Valley giants behind the most powerful AI systems, Britain has adopted a more light-touch approach. In 2025, the state of AI regulation globally could be in for a major overhaul. CNBC takes a look at some of the key developments to watch — from the evolution of the EU's landmark AI Act to what a Trump administration could do for the U.S.\n\nMusk's U.S. policy influence\n\nElon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on the day of a meeting with Senate Republican Leader-elect John Thune (R-SD), in Washington, U.S. December 5, 2024. Benoit Tessier | Reuters\n\nAlthough it's not an issue that featured very heavily during Trump's election campaign, artificial intelligence is expected to be one of the key sectors set to benefit from the next U.S. administration. For one, Trump appointed Musk, CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla , to co-lead his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" alongside Ramaswamy, an American biotech entrepreneur who dropped out of the 2024 presidential election race to back Trump. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, told CNBC Trump's close relationship with Musk could put the U.S. in a good position when it comes to AI, citing the billionaire's experience as a co-founder of OpenAI and CEO of xAI, his own AI lab, as positive indicators. \"We've finally got one person in the U.S. administration who truly knows about AI and has an opinion about it,\" Calkins said in an interview last month. Musk was one of Trump's most prominent endorsers in the business community, even appearing at some of his campaign rallies.\n\nThere is currently no confirmation on what Trump has planned in terms of possible presidential directives or executive orders. But Calkins thinks it's likely Musk will look to suggest guardrails to ensure AI development doesn't endanger civilization — a risk he's warned about multiple times in the past. \"He has an unquestioned reluctance to allow AI to cause catastrophic human outcomes – he's definitely worried about that, he was talking about it long before he had a policy position,\" Calkins told CNBC. Currently, there is no comprehensive federal AI legislation in the U.S. Rather, there's been a patchwork of regulatory frameworks at the state and local level, with numerous AI bills introduced across 45 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe European Union is so far the only jurisdiction globally to drive forward comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence with its AI Act. Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe European Union has so far been the only jurisdiction globally to push forward with comprehensive statutory rules for the AI industry. Earlier this year, the bloc's AI Act — a first-of-its-kind AI regulatory framework — officially entered into force. The law isn't yet fully in force yet, but it's already causing tension among large U.S. tech companies, who are concerned that some aspects of the regulation are too strict and may quash innovation. In December, the EU AI Office, a newly created body overseeing models under the AI Act, published a second-draft code of practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, which refers to systems like OpenAI's GPT family of large language models, or LLMs. The second draft included exemptions for providers of certain open-source AI models. Such models are typically available to the public to allow developers to build their own custom versions. It also includes a requirement for developers of \"systemic\" GPAI models to undergo rigorous risk assessments. The Computer & Communications Industry Association — whose members include Amazon , Google and Meta — warned it \"contains measures going far beyond the Act's agreed scope, such as far-reaching copyright measures.\" The AI Office wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It's worth noting the EU AI Act is far from reaching full implementation. As Shelley McKinley, chief legal officer of popular code repository platform GitHub, told CNBC in November, \"the next phase of the work has started, which may mean there's more ahead of us than there is behind us at this point.\" For example, in February, the first provisions of the Act will become enforceable. These provisions cover \"high-risk\" AI applications such as remote biometric identification, loan decisioning and educational scoring. A third draft of the code on GPAI models is slated for publication that same month. European tech leaders are concerned about the risk that punitive EU measures on U.S. tech firms could provoke a reaction from Trump, which might in turn cause the bloc to soften its approach. Take antitrust regulation, for example. The EU's been an active player taking action to curb U.S. tech giants' dominance — but that's something that could result in a negative response from Trump, according to Swiss VPN firm Proton's CEO Andy Yen. \"[Trump's] view is he probably wants to regulate his tech companies himself,\" Yen told CNBC in a November interview at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. \"He doesn't want Europe to get involved.\"\n\nUK copyright review\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer gives a media interview while attending the 79th United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, U.S. September 25, 2024. Leon Neal | Via Reuters\n\nOne country to watch for is the U.K. Previously, Britain has shied away from introducing statutory obligations for AI model makers due to the fear that new legislation could be too restrictive. However, Keir Starmer's government has said it plans to draw up legislation for AI, although details remain thin for now. The general expectation is that the U.K. will take a more principles-based approach to AI regulation, as opposed to the EU's risk-based framework. Last month, the government dropped its first major indicator for where regulation is moving, announcing a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Copyright is a big issue for generative AI and LLMs, in particular. Most LLMs use public data from the open web to train their AI models. But that often includes examples of artwork and other copyrighted material. Artists and publishers like the New York Times allege that these systems are unfairly scraping their valuable content without consent to generate original output. To address this issue, the U.K. government is considering making an exception to copyright law for AI model training, while still allowing rights holders to opt out of having their works used for training purposes. Appian's Calkins said that the U.K. could end up being a \"global leader\" on the issue of copyright infringement by AI models, adding that the country isn't \"subject to the same overwhelming lobbying blitz from domestic AI leaders that the U.S. is.\"\n\nU.S.-China relations a possible point of tension\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Xi Jinping, China's president, walk past members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLastly, as world governments seek to regulate fast-growing AI systems, there's a risk geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. In his first term as president, Trump enforced a number of hawkish policy measures on China, including a decision to add Huawei to a trade blacklist restricting it from doing business with American tech suppliers. He also launched a bid to ban TikTok,which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, in the U.S. — although he's since softened his position on TikTok. China is racing to beat the U.S. for dominance in AI. At the same time, the U.S. has taken measures to restrict China's access to key technologies, mainly chips like those designed by Nvidia, which are required to train more advanced AI models. China has responded by attempting to build its own homegrown chip industry. Technologists worry that a geopolitical fracturing between the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence could result in other risks, such as the potential for one of the two to develop a form of AI smarter than humans. Max Tegmark, founder of the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, believes the U.S. and China could in future create a form of AI that can improve itself and design new systems without human supervision, potentially forcing both countries' governments to individually come up with rules around AI safety. \"My optimistic path forward is the U.S. and China unilaterally impose national safety standards to prevent their own companies from doing harm and building uncontrollable AGI, not to appease the rivals superpowers, but just to protect themselves,\" Tegmark told CNBC in a November interview. Governments are already trying to work together to figure out how to create regulations and frameworks around AI. In 2023, the U.K. hosted a global AI safety summit, which the U.S. and China administrations both attended, to discuss potential guardrails around the technology. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report",

Mr. Ramaswamy decided to step aside from the project just before Mr. Trump assumed office on Monday.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, now has full command of the federal cost-cutting effort, which Mr. Trump has hailed as “potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time.” How exactly Mr. Musk wields his consolidated power to set the tempo and targets of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency remains to be seen. But his first moves suggest he will oversee something closer to an I.T. project than the sweeping operation to slash at least $2 trillion from the federal budget that Mr. Musk had once predicted.\n\nThe Musk-led project debuted this week with a bit of bureaucratic jujitsu: the takeover of an existing arm of the White House that, for the past decade, had focused on improving government technology.

        "content": "The tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday apply to most of the world.\n\nPresident Trump announced what could be one of the most drastic economic policy changes in decades on Wednesday, when he substituted America’s longstanding system of taxing imports with a new tariff system of his own devising.\n\nThe president said the tariffs would reverse decades of what he called unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States.\n\n“The markets are going to boom” and “the country is going to boom,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday, as global financial markets suffered their biggest rout in years. He added that other countries “have taken advantage of us for many, many years.”\n\nEconomists’ estimates have been far more grim, with most predicting that the president’s sweeping tariffs and likely retaliation will slow U.S. economic growth, push up costs for consumers and make life difficult for businesses that depend on international supply chains.\n\nThe president’s measure is both consequential and complicated.\n\nWhat did the president just do?\n\nMr. Trump announced two big tariff plans that apply to most of the world. One component is a “base line” tariff of 10 percent that will apply broadly to nearly all U.S. imports, except for products coming from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe second measure is what the president is calling a “reciprocal” tariff. That levy will apply to 57 countries that Mr. Trump says have high tariffs and other unfair economic practices that have hurt American exporters. He said this is a reciprocal tariff because it will match the way other countries treat the United States.\n\nBut the tariff that Mr. Trump announced is not actually based on other countries’ tariffs or other economic barriers to U.S. trade. The number is calculated based on the U.S. trade deficit, which is a measure of the difference between what the United States sells to a country and what it buys from it.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs range from 1 percent to 40 percent and will be added to the 10 percent base line tariff.\n\nThe 10 percent tariffs will go into effect on Saturday, and the reciprocal rates next Wednesday.\n\nWhich countries were targeted most by the tariffs?\n\nThe tariffs put a heavy burden on some of America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Japan, Germany, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nNotably, Canada and Mexico were not included. Mr. Trump hit those countries with a 25 percent tariff on many of their exports last month, though he also provided an exception for products that qualify for the trade agreement he signed in 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The countries are also subject to tariffs Mr. Trump has applied globally on cars, steel and aluminum, and the administration appears to have decided that America’s closest neighbors did not need further tariffs.\n\nBut the new tariffs will hit other allies with substantial levies. European goods will face a 20 percent tariff, Japanese goods will face 24 percent and South Korean products 26 percent.\n\nBecause of the way the tariff was calculated, Asian countries that send the United States a lot of exports but don’t buy much in return will see some of the highest rates.\n\nChinese exports face an extra 34 percent tariff. That is on top of a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump applied in recent months and other levies from his first term. As a result, some products from China will face a tariff of 79 percent.\n\nVietnam — where many companies moved their factories after Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term — will now face a 46 percent tariff on its exports, while Cambodian exports will be taxed at 49 percent.\n\nThe White House also did not apply tariffs to Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, arguing that these countries are already subject to heavy sanctions. But U.S. imports from Russia were $3 billion last year; small compared to many countries, but far larger than tiny countries like Lesotho and the Falkland Islands, which Mr. Trump chose to hit with substantial tariffs.\n\nWhat is the president’s goal?\n\nImage Mr. Trump said the tariffs will reverse decades of unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nThe president and his advisers say their goal is to make the tariffs so painful that they force companies to make their products in the United States. They argue that this will create more American jobs and push up wages.\n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”\n\nOne of the biggest questions is whether the president sees these tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and would be willing to remove them in return for concessions from other countries.\n\nThe administration has given mixed signals on that front. It seems unlikely that the president will remove the 10 percent base line tariff he has issued globally. And if the administration is truly looking for U.S. trade deficits with other countries to be eliminated, that may be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nBut in the executive order he signed, the president said that if countries eliminate their unfair trade practices, or the U.S. trade deficit with them drops, the reciprocal tariffs could be rolled back.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the commerce secretary, described other countries’ trade barriers as “the monster that needs to be slayed.”\n\n“Our teams are talking to all the great trading partners today,” Mr. Lutnick said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “It is time for them to do deep soul-searching on how they treat us poorly and how to make it right.”\n\nHow did they come up with the numbers?\n\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that each nation’s tariff rate would be calculated based on “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.” But it turned out that their methodology revolved around something more straightforward: the gap between what America exports to a country and what it imports.\n\nThe White House put out a complicated-looking formula, but it boiled down to a simple ratio. Countries that send the U.S. more goods than they buy were deemed to have “unbalanced” trade and will face higher tariffs.\n\nThis formula doesn’t account for any comparative advantage, or the idea that countries trade goods because some are better at making some products than others, and that countries can trade to maximize their benefits. Instead, the administration’s point of view appears to be that any trade deficit is bad, and tariffs will be applied until it is eliminated.\n\nHow do the tariffs work?\n\nAs they go into effect over the next week, the tariffs will immediately increase the cost for importers bringing goods into the country. Typically, those importers are U.S. companies.\n\nFor example, if Walmart brings in a $10 shoe from Vietnam — which faces a 46 percent tariff — Walmart will owe $4.60 in additional tariffs to the U.S. government.\n\nIt’s less clear what happens next. Walmart could try to force the cost onto the Vietnamese shoe manufacturer, by telling it Walmart will pay less for the product. Walmart could cut into its own profit margins and absorb the cost of the tariff. Or, it could raise the price it sells shoes for at its stores, to make up the cost.\n\nEconomists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that the tariffs on steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.\n\nEstimates vary, but given the scale of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs, American households could see thousands of dollars of additional costs annually. An estimate released by the Yale Budget Lab, a research group, found that American households on average would pay an additional $2,100 because of the April 2 announcement, with poorer households paying a larger share of their income.\n\nThe particularly high tariffs that the Trump administration applied to many Asian countries means that the price of many consumer items will likely increase, including shoes, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe government will earn a lot more revenue from tariffs that the Trump administration has promised to channel into tax cuts. The value of tariffs for all the goods imported by the United States last year was $78 billion. With the new tariffs announced on Wednesday, the figure would skyrocket to more than $1 trillion, according to an analysis by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a research firm based in Washington.\n\nWhat happens next with the economy?\n\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets, indicating that investors see it as significantly harmful for listed companies.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, or how, other countries will retaliate. But if they impose their own tariffs on U.S. products, that will likely hurt U.S. exporters and could spark escalating trade wars.\n\nMany analysts quickly downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, saying that tariffs would push up prices for consumers and costs for businesses, slowing demand and economic activity.\n\nNancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, estimated the U.S. economy might contract 1 percent in the second quarter. She had previously expected a flat quarter. “It’s an immediate hit to the economy,” she said.\n\nEconomists at Fitch Ratings said in a note Thursday that the tariffs had significantly raised the risk for a recession in the United States. It said that tariffs would result in higher consumer prices that would squeeze real wages and weigh on consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs would also lead to lower corporate profits, which, along with policy uncertainty, would drag on business investment in the United States. Altogether, the effect would “likely outweigh the benefits U.S. companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch economists said.\n\nLazaro Gamio and Colby Smith contributed reporting.",

The French celebrate the liberation of Paris from the Nazis on Aug. 25, 1944, and the Italians celebrate the beginning of the popular uprising and general strike that overthrew the Fascists and Mussolini on April 25, 1945.\n\nWhen did Trump begin referring to a 'liberation day?'\n\nIt grew over several weeks in March of this year, though the formulation had a much longer run-up than that. Trump referred to several days as \"liberation day\" during his last presidential campaign. In February 2024, he told a conservative audience that Election Day, Nov. 5, \"will he our liberation day\" and repeated it several times after that. Then, Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2025, became \"liberation day,\" with Trump repeating that at his inaugural address.\n\nDuring a speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Trump said, \"We are achieving the great liberation of America but there still is much work to be done\" and spoke about his plans to implement what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other nations, adding \"Whatever they tax us, we tax them.\" By St. Patrick's Day on March 17, Trump was telling reporters, according to the Washington Post, that April 2 \"is a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries.\"\n\nWhat's going to happen on this 'liberation day?'\n\nAs of this writing, on March 31, no one knows. Trump has already announced a lot of tariffs — on imported steel and aluminum, which are already in effect; on imported autos and auto parts, which are set to go into effect at midnight April 3, and have Detroit automakers extraordinarily concerned about the additional pressures and costs to Canadian and Mexican supply lines they rely on; on Chinese goods generally and any country buying oil from Venezuela — but the new set of taxes or tariffs are a mystery for now.\n\nTrump first talked about a broad series of import tariffs that would not only match the tariffs charged by other countries but also account for other economic obstacles to U.S. trade, such as quotas that might limit the level of imports allowed into a country, or value-added taxes like those in Europe and elsewhere that can add to the price of imported goods. Then, as recently as last week, he was talking about being more lenient, saying otherwise his plans might be too tough and it looked like it might be restricted to certain trading partners. On Sunday night, he was again talking about them being broader and the Wall Street Journal said he was pushing aides to be more aggressive in applying them.\n\nStill, there seemed to be some room for compromise. After imposing the auto tariffs last week, Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had a call after which Trump suggested negotiations were possible, adding, \"I think things will work out very well between Canada and the United States.\"\n\nDoes Trump have a point on trade and tariffs?\n\nThe United States runs a deficit in terms of its trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. In January of this year, that deficit — meaning the value of imports compared with the value of U.S. exports — was about $131 billion, up from about $98 billion in December. The U.S. hasn't run a trade surplus, however, since the mid-1970s.\n\nTrump has consistently argued that is proof the U.S. is treated unfairly by its trading partners, and some labor leaders, including the UAW's Shawn Fain, have agreed, in part, saying tariffs will result in more work for U.S.-based manufacturing. And there are some claims that the U.S. may be more vulnerable financially or militarily if it doesn't protect its ability to make things.\n\nBut there is another argument that in a world with global supply chains, it makes more sense economically and diplomatically for the U.S. to spend less than it otherwise might on some consumer goods by using imports to lower prices on some items, freeing up more for wages, savings, investment and other goods. It is hard for economists to imagine U.S. wages falling to a level where they would meet those in some other parts of the world and provide an advantage for U.S. exports. Meanwhile, there are questions as to what damage could be done to businesses; major manufacturers are not able to willy-nilly change product lines, open factories and alter supply chains, circumstances that can take years to plan and execute, lasting longer than a president's term.\n\nIf Trump is able to use tariffs as a way to pull more business into the U.S. and negotiate better access to foreign markets for American-made goods, while raising some revenue for the federal government to offset promised tax extensions, he may be widely praised. If, on the other hand, his actions lead to a possible recession — after what had been a period of stock market and job expansion, despite higher prices — it could lead to strong reaction among the public, if history is any guide.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — In President Donald Trump’s idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s, when top hats and shirtwaists were fashionable and typhoid fever often killed more soldiers than combat.\n\nIt was the Gilded Age, a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system, when poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth, like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped boost their financial empires.\n\n“We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept,” Trump said days after taking office. “It’s fine. It’s OK. But it would have been very much better.”\n\nThe desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump’s fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation’s 25th president, William McKinley, a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901.\n\nThough Trump’s early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent — with him imposing them, then pulling many back — he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country’s foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump doesn’t rule out recession while downplaying business concerns about his tariffs\n\nExperts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They argue he’s also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods.\n\nAnd Gilded Age policies, they maintain, have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized, modern economy.\n\n“The most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy — except for the very rich — wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy,” said Richard White, a history professor emeritus at Stanford University.\n\nTrump says high tariffs and low interest rates, like those the U.S. had after the Civil War, can hastily pay down today’s federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S.\n\nIt’s not a new theme for him.\n\n“I am a Tariff Man,” Trump declared in a 2018 online post. Campaigning for a second term last fall, Trump said of the McKinley era, “We were a very wealthy country, and we’re going to be doing that now.” Today, he says “tariff” is his favorite word and represents “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form.”\n\nThe White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising that import levies will soon increase on the European Union, as well as new, foreign-made cars, microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he later delayed most of them.\n\nHe has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with, saying broad “reciprocal” import taxes are coming April 2nd and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods.\n\nDartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said Trump advocating for modern tariffs by pointing to the 1890s is flawed.\n\n“We did grow rapidly in the late 19th century,” he said. “But it’s a stretch to attribute it to tariffs.”\n\n“The president is more accurate when he paints with a broader brush and says, ’Look, this entire period with fiscal surpluses we grew rapidly.’ That’s true of this 40-year period,” added Irwin, author of “Clashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.”\n\n“But, when you dig down to the details and say, ‘We raised tariffs in this instance,’ that’s where things go awry. Or the story doesn’t quite hold together as well,” Irwin said.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 things to know about tariffs and how they work\n\nWas America really at its wealthiest from 1870 to 1913?\n\nThe Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans. The name comes from a 1873 novel, co-written by Mark Twain, which satirized the greed and deceit of the era’s government and politicians.\n\nMany contemporary leaders were openly influenced by the famed robber barons, builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked.\n\nRockefeller became the exemplar of the era when his Standard Oil empire made him the world’s first billionaire. Morgan was an investment banker and legendary financier of industrial interests. Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed a breathtaking fortune through shipping and railroads, while steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was also a dedicated philanthropist who argued the rich had a moral responsibility to use their wealth to better a deeply unequal society.\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913, though there were dips and recessions, too.\n\nSome historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output. New industries like steel, electricity and petrochemicals boomed, as did sectors including construction and machinery.\n\nBut White said those years were marked by erratic economic growth, and those upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce. Indeed, the number of U.S. residents jumped from 38.5 million-plus in 1870 to more than 106 million by 1920.\n\nAnother factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west. That meant exploiting natural resources along the way — including gold, silver, timber, grazing and farmland, as well as coal, copper and oil, especially after the discovery of the Spindletop geyser in Texas in 1901.\n\nAverage wages rose, but so did inequality, with almost no social safety net. Working conditions were often so abhorrent, meanwhile, that the labor movement began gaining strength, as did progressive politicians clamoring for breaking up monopolies.\n\n“This is the height of antimonopoly, political turmoil, the rise of labor in the United States,” said White, author of “The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896.” “And the reason was, people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy.”\n\nIn fact, despite the growth, standards of living fell, including life expectancy and key health indicators, White said.\n\nCould tariffs replace the federal income tax?\n\nThe modern federal income tax came into fruition with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can’t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget in almost incalculable ways.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the federal government collected about $4 trillion in individual income tax and tax withholdings, according to the Treasury Department, compared with customs duties accounting for around $76.4 billion.\n\nBut the president nonetheless signed a Day 1 executive order calling for the creation of the External Revenue Service to “collect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Trump’s goal there was “to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay.”\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove, author of “The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters,” has defended the notion of low, reciprocal tariffs on U.S. foreign trading partners.\n\nBut Rove also says that tariffs can’t realistically replace a federal income tax. He noted in a February op-ed that from 1863 to 1913 tariffs brought in nearly half the U.S. government’s revenue but last year they accounted for less than 2% of federal revenue.\n\nWhy does Trump so revere McKinley?\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump called McKinley a “great president” and “natural business man,” who he said “made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” Hours later, he signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America’s tallest peak Mount McKinley.\n\nBut today’s economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley’s time.\n\nGlobal communication is now virtually instantaneous. Back then, communication was cumbersome and products were often fully assembled before being exported. Shipping could take months. Today’s goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled that are sourced all over the world and then built in places different from where they are ultimately sold.\n\nThe disruption of such carefully calibrated, multinational logistical systems by the coronavirus pandemic was a key reason why everything from leather couches to flooring to microchips for new cars suddenly became scarce. And that helped feed record inflation beginning in 2021 that continues to dog the U.S. economy today.\n\nRobert W. Merry, author of “President McKinley: Architect of the American Century,” said McKinley was the leading voice on tariffs at a time when they dominated policy discussions because they were the federal government’s chief source of revenue, given that no income tax existed.\n\nBut Trump differs with McKinley in using tariffs as a “bludgeon to get other countries to do our bidding on efforts that have nothing to do with revenue, or economic matters or trade.” The president has done that with Canada and Mexico, using tariff threats to try to force those countries to take harder lines against drug smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\n“Nobody would have even considered such a thing in McKinley’s day,” Merry said.\n\nMcKinley champions the Tariff Act of 1890\n\nMcKinley hailed from Canton, in northeast Ohio and was son of an iron foundries owner who was especially sensitive to overseas competition. He won a seat in Congress representing a steel-producing district and so promoted tariffs that one humor magazine used a cartoon on its cover to unflatteringly dub him the “Napoleon of Protectionism.”\n\nAs chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which set the then-highest import tax in U.S. history, raising taxes to 49.5% on 1,500-plus items — everything from glass to tin plates to cayenne pepper. The results were quickly poor for the economy and for Republicans.\n\n“It led to an increase in prices, a kind of inflation, even before the bill took effect,” Merry said. “The argument was, it was carte blanche for retailers and industrialists who basically jacked up their prices unnecessarily.”\n\nAmericans dealt Republicans landslide congressional defeats during the 1890 midterms, voting scores of incumbents out of office — including McKinley. The tariff fallout also helped Grover Cleveland win the White House for Democrats in 1892, after he lost his reelection the previous cycle.\n\nMcKinley rebounded, though. He was elected Ohio governor and eventually won the presidency in 1896 on a campaign slogan Trump has repeated: “I am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform.” His campaign also got boosts from big donations by major industrialists like Rockefeller, who were strongly opposed to McKinley’s populist Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan.\n\nJust as in McKinley’s time, today’s business titans have worked to ingratiate themselves to Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among the technology leaders who traveled to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, was already a fixture, before Inauguration Day.\n\nMeta, Google and Microsoft joined other major firms donating $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, while Amazon Prime Video is set to distribute a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Some business interests are hoping Trump will usher in a new era of antitrust, in which the government does less to block highly profitable corporate consolidation.\n\nWhat was the ‘great tariff commission’?\n\nIgnoring some of the political problems tariffs created for Republicans in his favored era, Trump instead has focused on repeating how import taxes after the Civil War helped the U.S. pay off debts it incurred during the fighting — and eventually achieve government budget surpluses.\n\nFrom 1866 to 1893, the U.S. ran nearly three straight decades of budget surpluses, fueled largely by tariffs and high domestic taxes on things like alcohol and tobacco, as well as the sale of federal lands. Paying down debt helped lower interest rates.\n\nTrump has even begun trumpeting what he calls the “great tariff commission of 1887,” which the president says was tasked with helping the government spend all those surpluses.\n\nIrwin said there was a tariff commission, but it was actually convened five years earlier in 1882. It also recommended reducing tariffs, which Congress didn’t do.\n\n“It’s hard to say it was a political success. It’s hard to say it was an economic success,” Irwin said. “Because we spent a lot of the 1890s with double digit unemployment.”\n\nThat’s because federal budget surpluses eventually began to effectively decrease the U.S. money supply and cause deflation. Meanwhile, higher tariffs increased the cost of living for many Americans, which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893.\n\nThat resulted in railroad bankruptcies, a stock market crash and a crushing recession in which unemployment reached 25% nationally. Then-President Cleveland’s lack of solutions was a key factor in voters turning on him and the Democrats and toward McKinley three years later.\n\nMcKinley also differed with Trump on key issues\n\nTrump has used his opening weeks back in office to champion U.S. expansionism in ways unseen in the modern era.\n\nHe’s refused to rule out U.S. military forces seizing back control of the Panama Canal and suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, making Canada the 51st state and even working with Israel to put American developers in charge of turning the Gaza Strip into a seaside “Riviera.”\n\nThere are echoes of McKinley there, because, as president, he moved to expand the reach of the U.S. The Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico became American territories as part of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in December 1898.\n\nBut the comparison is not so easy. McKinley was also skeptical of U.S. expansionism, even writing himself a note at the start of the war and carrying it as a reminder, Merry said.\n\n“While we are conducting war, and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get,” the note said. “When the war is over, we must keep what we want.”\n\nShortly after winning reelection in 1900, meanwhile, McKinley began rethinking tariffs, as a stronger and still-growing U.S. manufacturing base made him more appreciative of foreign markets.\n\n“McKinley began to see that, if we were going to be able to sell our goods overseas — as we were going to need to do because we would have more goods than we’d have a market for — we were going to have to accept goods as well,” Merry said.\n\nHe said that McKinley gave a speech in Buffalo, New York, outlining “this concept of reciprocity, which was: I’m prepared to bring down tariffs. Even me. Even William McKinley.”\n\n“That was his first big initiative after being reelected,” Merry said.\n\nIn that speech on Sept. 5, 1901, McKinley said, “A policy of goodwill and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not.”\n\nTrump is now promising that similar, reciprocal tariffs will take effect next month. But actually successfully pulling that off will be another difference from McKinley, who never got the chance.\n\nThe day after his Buffalo speech, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. He died on Sept. 14, 1901.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump no longer plans to raise tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50% on Wednesday, top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro told CNBC on Tuesday afternoon. The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men.\n\nTrump's new trade threats\n\nThe moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them — and then partially delaying them again.\n\nFord had vowed to keep Ontario's tax in place, despite Trump's latest reprieve. \"There's one person to be blamed, and that's President Trump,\" Ford said on CNBC. \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession. No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeparately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war.",

Still, some analysts remain bullish on Palantir’s outlook, arguing that the company’s suite of AI-powered analytics software places it in a position to benefit from efforts by the Trump White House to improve government efficiency. Palantir shares rose 2.2% to close at $78.05 on Tuesday, rebounding from the previous session's 10% decline. The stock has fallen 38% since hitting a record high three weeks ago, but the price is still three times what it was a year ago. After a bearish engulfing pattern signaled a record high in the stock last month, Palantir shares have moved lower on increasing trading volume, with bearish price action continuing into this week. Source: TradingView.com. Despite the recent decline, the relative strength index (RSI) index remains above the key 50 threshold and sits in a location that has generally corresponded with the low of several key retracements on the chart dating back to early 2023. Investors should watch crucial support levels on Palantir's chart around $66, $44 and $30, while also monitoring important overhead areas near $85 and $121.

Ivan Romano / Getty Images Viking reported solid Q4 results, with revenue of $1.35 billion, in line with Visible Alpha estimates. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents surpassed expectations. As of Feb. 23, the company had recorded $5.3 billion in advance bookings year-to-date for 2025, up 26% year-over-year. \"These are very good trends for 2025,\" Viking CEO Tor Hagen said on the call. \"I will highlight that depending on the market conditions we might not want to be booked too far out as we look to optimize pricing.\" Viking shares closed 6.1% lower on Tuesday. The stock is still up 67% from the company's initial public offering price of $24 last spring.\n\n-Aaron Rennie\n\nAsana Plunges as CEO Moskowitz Steps Down Shares of Asana (ASAN) lost nearly a quarter of their value on Tuesday following news CEO Dustin Moskovitz would step down, as the work management platform provider gave a weak fiscal 2026 outlook. The company announced late Monday that company co-founder Moskovitz has decided to leave as soon as a new CEO is named. Asana added that Moskovitz will continue as board chair and plans to retain his shares. The San Francisco-based Asana was founded 17 years ago by Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein, who met while both were leading engineering teams at Facebook, now part of Meta Platforms (META). The two came up with the idea of creating a technology that would make it easier for employees to coordinate their work. Along with the Moskovitz news, the company reported that it expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $782 million to $790 million, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $803.6 million. Asana shares closed 24% lower at $12.64 on Tuesday. The stock, which started trading in 2020, is a far cry from its late-2021 record high of around $145. -Bill McColl\n\nAI Stocks Rebound with 'Fundamentals Still Intact' Many of the biggest AI investor plays rebounded on Tuesday. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, up 10.7%. Several other popular AI stocks were among the day’s best performers, including nuclear power provider Vistra (VST), up 5.4%, and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), up 1.7%. AI stocks may have found some support on Tuesday by investors willing to buy the dip after a dramatic pullback. Shares of AI software company Palantir (PLTR) lost about 40% of their value between hitting a record high in mid-February and yesterday’s close. The stock rebounded 4% today. Applovin (APP), which surged more than 700% last year on AI-fueled growth, was down more than 50% from its mid-February record high before rebounding about 8% today. Tesla (TSLA), which tumbled 15% yesterday to close 53% off its post-election high, advanced nearly 4% on Tuesday. Sky-high valuations were one major reason AI stocks have been hit particularly hard by the tariff sell-off. But the AI trade had already lost momentum before Trump’s tariffs shook the broader stock market. Concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure, slowing growth at AI bellwether Nvidia, and competition from Chinese competitors led the AI rally to stall in late January and early February. UBS analysts in a note on Tuesday expressed optimism that the current sell-off will play out like a similar rout in 2018. The analysts argued that the tech slump during Trump's first term, in which geopolitics and “fundamentals-related noise” briefly clouded investors’ view of an otherwise strong outlook, resembles today’s. There are risks around escalating trade wars, the analysts note. “But with AI fundamentals still intact, investors should not lose sight of the long-term risk-reward and should take advantage of extreme volatility through buying-the-dip in quality AI stocks and structured strategies.” -Colin Laidley\n\nInvestors are Watching This Key Indicator as S&P 500 Slumps The S&P 500 on Monday fell below its 200-day moving average—a \"key technical indicator\" and gauge of market momentum—for the first time since 2023. An index crossing below its 200-day moving average can reflect either short-term volatility or the beginning of a prolonged slump. Citi analysts wrote in a recent note that falling stocks and economic uncertainty could encourage companies to put cash toward stock buybacks rather than capital investments, potentially offering support to stock prices. Read the full article here. -Colin Laidley\n\nTesla Surges After Sell-Off Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped Tuesday, after losing more than 15% of their value a day earlier. The stock was up 5% at around $233 in late trading, making back a small fraction of what it’s lost amid an extended sell-off since President Trump took office. The stock is on pace to fall for the eighth consecutive week, even after the uptick on Tuesday. TradingView Tesla's stock price had surged to a record close of $479.86 about a month after Trump’s election victory, but since Musk started working in the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency in January, the EV maker's shares have lost almost half their value. Recent losses have come amid worries about slowing sales in China and declining registrations in Europe, as well as widespread market uncertainty about tariffs. However, Tesla’s precipitous slide could be an opportunity for investors to buy low, analysts at Morgan Stanley told clients Monday. The analysts reiterated a price target of $430, calling Tesla its “top pick” among U.S. automakers, bolstered by artificial intelligence and robotics potential. The consensus price target for Tesla stock is about $366 among analysts who follow Tesla and are tracked by Visible Alpha. -Andrew Kessel\n\nSmall Business Owners' Confidence Drops as Uncertainty Rises Small business owners, who largely cheered Donald Trump's election, are starting to feel uncertain about the future amid the president's rapid policy changes.\n\n\n\nOptimism among small businesses fell in February, according to a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses released Tuesday. An index measuring uncertainty rose to its second-highest level in the survey's 50-year history. Despite the downtick, business optimism remained above its historical average. Small businesses have historically applauded Trump and his policies. The confidence index hit what at the time was its highest point ever in 2016, the first time Trump was elected. And after Trump won re-election last year, the index surged. The survey highlighted the uncertainty taking hold in the business community. Trump's on-again, off-again threats to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners have made planning for the future cloudier and raised concerns about rising costs and inflation reigniting. Business owners are responding to the developments by raising prices, according to the survey. The net percentage of businesses raising prices rose 10 percentage points to 32%, the biggest jump since 2021, and the third-highest level on record.\n\n\n\n\"Although economic perceptions remain much more constructive than in recent years, the recent flurry of tariff activity appears to have dented economic expectations and put upward pressure on small business prices,\" Charlie Dougherty, Jackie Benson, and Ali Hajibeigi, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary. -Diccon Hyatt\n\nAirlines Scale Back Outlooks as Demand Softens Three of the largest U.S. airlines—Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and American Airlines (AAL)—have lowered their projections for the first quarter of the year, citing weakening travel demand amid an uncertain economy. Delta said it expects first-quarter revenue to rise 3% to 4% rather than the 7% to 9% growth it projected previously, citing a \"recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in Domestic demand.\" Southwest and American Airlines have also cut their revenue outlooks. American projected a larger loss than previously expected and Southwest announced a slate of new revenue-generating measures like charging for checked luggage. American cited \"softness in the domestic leisure segment\" along with a negative impact on bookings after the January Washington, D.C., crash involving one of its planes. Southwest cited the impact of the January wildfires in Los Angeles—but also \"softness in bookings and demand trends as the macro environment has weakened.\" The trend is also hitting smaller airlines. JetBlue (JBLU) lowered its first-quarter projection for available seat miles because of more weather disruptions and \"demand choppiness due to mixed macroeconomic indicators.\" \"We believe airline industry demand will likely bounce along the trough until macro stability is reached,\" Bank of America analysts wrote Monday. -Aaron McDade\n\nTeradyne Plunges as Company Warns on Impact of Tariffs Shares of Teradyne (TER) plummeted to lead S&P 500 decliners Tuesday, as the maker of testing equipment for chips and electronics updated its guidance in response to the potential impact of Trump administration trade moves. In a presentation ahead of its Investor Day, the company said that it sees short-term volatility \"mainly in SemiTest business,\" as well as new uncertainty around tariffs and trade restrictions. It added it doesn’t expect cancellations, \"but some push outs and capital reviews.\" Teradyne didn't forecast any changes to its outlook for the current quarter but anticipates second-quarter revenue to be flat to down 10% from the first quarter and full-year revenue up 5% to 10% year-over-year. For fiscal 2026, the company predicts earnings per share (EPS) and revenue \"trending toward the low end of the previous 2026 earnings model.\" In addition to the update, Teradyne also announced it bought privately held Quantifi Photonics for an undisclosed price. Quantifi manufactures photonic integrated circuit testing devices. TradingView Teradyne shares, which entered Tuesday little changed over the past year, were down 18% in recent trading, at their lowest level in more than a year.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Jumps After News of Baggage Fees Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares surged Tuesday after the airline announced its latest revenue-generating changes amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. The airline said it would introduce a basic economy ticket option and baggage fees, ending some of Southwest's trademark perks. Certain members of the airline's rewards program will still be eligible for one or two free checked bags once the policy changes for flights booked on or after May 28. The introduction of baggage fees are the newest change for Southwest, which in July announced an end to its famed open seating policy and introduced overnight flights, which started last month. The airline has since said it plans to start booking assigned seating flights in the second half of this year and roll out the changes in 2026. “What’s changed is that we’ve come to realize that we need more revenue to cover our costs,” Southwest COO Andrew Watterson told CNBC Tuesday. “We think that these changes that we’re announcing today will lead to less of that share shift than would have been the case otherwise.\" The changes follow months of disputes with Elliott, which built a stake in Southwest last year and pushed for changes at the executive and board level. In October, the sides agreed to a settlement that saw five Elliott-backed candidates added to Southwest's board. Also on Tuesday, Southwest lowered its projected growth for first-quarter revenue per available seat mile to a year-over-year increase of 2% to 4%, from 5% to 7% previously. TradingView Southwest shares were up more than 6% in recent trading. Despite Tuesday's gains, they've lost about 10% of their value since the start of the year. -Aaron McDade\n\nKohl's Stock Plunges on Disappointing Outlook Shares of Kohl's (KSS) plunged in early trading after the struggling retailer's forecasts fell short of analysts' expectations. For fiscal 2025, Kohl's projects net sales to fall 5% to 7%, comparable sales to fall 4% to 6%, and earnings per share (EPS) of between $0.10 and $0.60. Analysts were looking for 2025 net sales to decline by about 2%, comparable sales to decline by 1.83%, and EPS of $1.26, according to Visible Alpha data. The department store chain's fiscal fourth-quarter results were mixed, with profits lagging analysts' projections. It posted EPS of $0.43 on net revenue of $5.4 billion. (After adjusting for one-time costs like store closures, Kohl's adjusted EPS of $0.95 topped estimates.) Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.71 and $5.38 billion, respectively. Last year, Kohl's registered profit of $1.67 per share and sales of $5.96 billion. Comparable store sales fell by 6.7%, a bit better than the 6.9% decline that analysts had projected. Kohl's missed estimates last quarter, when its said craft store chain Michaels Cos. CEO Ashley Buchanan would be replacing Tom Kingsbury as chief executive. TradingView Kohl's shares were down 15% in recent trading and have lost more than 60% of their value over the past year. The stock dipped below $10 for the first time since 1997 this morning. -Aaron McDade\n\nTesla Prices to Watch After Stock's 50% Decline from Record Tesla (TSLA) shares moved slightly higher in premarket trading after tumbling 15% on Monday to lead S&P decliners, closing below their Election Day level for the first time. Since hitting a record high in mid-December, Tesla shares have fallen 55% amid investor concerns about potential fallout from Musk's extensive involvement in the Trump administration and weak sales figures. Tesla shares fell below the closely watched 200-week moving average in Monday’s trading session. Moreover, increasing volumes have accompanied the recent drop, signaling selling participation by larger market players, such as institutional investors and hedge funds. Source: TradingView.com. While the relative strength index confirms bearish momentum with a reading below 50, the indicator has moved into a region that has typically corresponded with bounces in the stock stretching back to May 2022. Investors should monitor key support levels on Tesla's chart around $215 and $165, while also watching major resistance levels near $265 and $300. The stock was up 0.4% at $223 in recent premarket trading. Read the full technical analysis piece here. -Timothy Smith",

        "content": "the new new world\n\nAs the United States grapples with the upheaval unleashed by the Trump administration, many Chinese people are finding they can relate to what many Americans are going through.\n\nThey are saying it feels something like the Cultural Revolution, the period known as “the decade of turmoil.” The young aides Elon Musk has sent to dismantle the U.S. government reminded some Chinese of the Red Guards whom Mao Zedong enlisted to destroy the bureaucracy at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. Upon hearing President Trump’s musing about serving a third term, they joked that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, must be saying, “I know how to do it” — he secured one in 2022 by engineering a constitutional change.\n\nThe United States helped China modernize and expand its economy in the hope that China would become more like America — more democratic and more open. Now for some Chinese, the United States is looking more and more like China.\n\n“Coming from an authoritarian state, we know that dictatorship is not just a system — it is, at its core, the pursuit of power,” Wang Jian, a journalist, wrote in an X post criticizing Mr. Trump. “We also know that the Cultural Revolution was about dismantling institutions to expand control.”\n\nFor these Chinese, who strive for democratic values but contend with an authoritarian state, their role model is tearing itself down. They are expressing their alarm in interviews, articles and social media comments that range in emotion from disappointment and anger to sardonic.\n\n“Beacon of democracy, 1776-2025,” wrote a commenter on a post by the official Weibo social media account of the U.S. Embassy in China.\n\nThey’re witnessing things they thought could happen only in China: sycophantic official announcements, intimidation of the media and top entrepreneurs vying for favor from the leadership, not to mention a president who calls himself a king.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity — it feels so much like China,” Zhang Wenmin, an investigative journalist known by her pen name, Jiang Xue, told me. Ms. Zhang was forced to leave China because of her work and moved to the United States in 2023. “I’ve just gotten out of the frying pan and into the fire,” she said.\n\nOf course, the two countries are fundamentally different.\n\nChina is a one-party state lacking in three pillars of the American system: liberty, democracy and the rule of law. Millions of Chinese died during the Cultural Revolution, and tens of millions were persecuted. What’s happening in the United States is far from that. “It’s not exactly parallel,” Ian Johnson, an American journalist who has been writing about China for decades, told me. “But historical parallels are never exact because history doesn’t really repeat itself.” The American system is tearing itself apart with no outside pressure, he said, and this is similar to what the Communist Party did at the peak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, which destroyed nearly all institutions in China, the country tried to build something like those American foundations. Despite official restrictions, lawyers, journalists and entrepreneurs built a budding civil society that tried to hold the government accountable.\n\nThese are the Chinese who suffered the most when Mr. Xi smothered efforts to make China a more open and democratic society, and they’re also the most disappointed at what’s happening in the United States.\n\nThey have been shocked by the abrupt changes in U.S. policy under President Trump. Most striking is the language government agencies have used in social media postings. The tone, people say, sounds like Chinese Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“Even the CCP’s embassy posts, with all its propaganda, doesn’t spend every single day obsessively praising Xi Jinping,” Deng Haiyan, a former police officer turned critic of the Chinese government, wrote on X.\n\n“You’d think People’s Daily had moved into the U.S. Consulate,” he wrote, referring to the official newspaper for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe official Weibo account of the U.S. Embassy in China, which has 3.5 million followers, used to be a platform for the U.S. government to spread American values and reliable information. Chinese who share those values would sometimes use the comment sections of the account to vent about their own government.\n\nR. Nicholas Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador in China until January, talked about the importance of using social media to interact with the Chinese public. “One of the major preoccupations of our mission,” he said in a speech in 2023, “is to try to tell the truth about American society, American history, U.S.-China relations to the Chinese people.”\n\nThat truth telling, he added, was meant to counter a distorted version of the United States from the Chinese official media. The Weibo account was intended as a Chinese-language bulletin board about American values.\n\nImage Mao Zedong with Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, in 1966. Credit... Universal History Archive/UIG, via Getty Images\n\nIn the past month, many of the embassy’s Weibo posts, which overlap with some of the posts on its X account, were flooded with angry comments from Chinese users expressing disappointment.\n\n“Shame on you!” many Weibo users with IP addresses in China commented on posts about the U.S. policies toward Ukraine.\n\nOn a post about remarks Mr. Trump made about human rights, one user wrote: “And you think you’re worthy of talking about human rights? You betrayed Ukraine!”\n\nThe changes of both content and style on the Weibo account led one commenter to tease the account’s social media editor: “Blink twice if you’ve been kidnapped.” The embassy press office declined to comment.\n\nFor many Chinese, the chaos in Washington is driven by a familiar impulse.\n\n“The only way to dismantle America’s ‘deep state’ is through a ‘Cultural Revolution,’” Zhang Qianfan, a professor of law at Peking University, wrote in a widely circulated article about the erosion of American democracy. “The Cultural Revolution brings neither honesty nor efficiency — only the demolition of the rule of law essential to everyone’s survival.”\n\nThe characteristics of authoritarian leaders, such as surrounding themselves with loyalists and trying to control the media, are not unique to China.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao promoted a semiliterate peasant to the office of vice premier and a low-level cadre at a textile mill to be his deputy at the age of 38.\n\nFor his third term, Mr. Xi has surrounded himself with loyalists, many of whom did not go to elite Chinese universities. Neither do they have lengthy experience working in the central government, unlike members of the previous two Chinese administrations.\n\nLast week, when the U.S. Embassy in China posted on its Weibo account that the White House would pick the media outlets allowed to participate in the presidential press pool, a user in the southwestern city Chongqing commented, “Selectively allowing certain media outlets to conduct interviews — such a familiar tactic.”\n\nFor Chinese, one of the most astonishing aspects is how fast Mr. Trump seems to be building a cult of personality.\n\nAfter he showed off hats that said “Trump was right about everything,” a user on X wrote in Chinese: “Mao Zedong of America has been born! Long live the great leader Chairman Trump — long live, long live, long long live!”\n\nLi Weiao, a Beijing-based journalist, posted a video clip on Weibo that shows Mr. Trump enjoying a standing ovation at his first cabinet meeting in his second term. “I think I truly underestimated the dark side of human nature,” he wrote on Weibo.\n\n“The rhythm of this applause feels so familiar,” a lawyer commented on Mr. Li’s post. Another commenter wrote: “Just like North Korea and its friend,” referring to China.\n\nIn a comment on an episode of my Chinese-language podcast, a YouTube viewer wrote a parody of a White House announcement in the style of Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“The entire Republican Party and all of America must unite even more closely around the White House Central Committee with President Trump at its core, holding high the great banner of American-style capitalism,” the user wrote. “We must fully implement Trump’s New Era American Capitalism Thought, stay united in purpose, uphold tradition while innovating, forge ahead with determination, and fight tirelessly to achieve the great MAGA goal!”",

        "content": "In the countdown to last year's American election, those of us tasked with taking the pulse of voters repeatedly heard the same two words:\n\n\"The economy.\"\n\nIt's a catch-all term, meaning different things to different people. But, as we straw-polled Donald Trump supporters on our travels, it was frequently cited as their top vote motivator.\n\nNow, eight weeks into Trump's presidency, talk about \"the economy\" is dominated by words like \"chaos\", \"uncertainty\" and a possible \"recession\".\n\nTeam Trump prefers euphemisms like \"transition\", \"disturbance\" and \"detox\", and argues any short-term pain will lead to long-term gain.\n\nBut the indices that measure business certainty, investor confidence and market stability are flying off the charts in the wrong direction.\n\nThis is the direct result of Trump's backwards-and-forwards tariffs policy.\n\nAs the US president slams hefty taxes on imports and constantly threatens more, goading long-time partners and allies into ugly fights, a global trade war is erupting.\n\nIt's America versus the world.\n\n## Two types of tariffs\n\nTrump is using tariffs for two different purposes.\n\nThe first type of tariff is designed to advance his \"America First\" trade policy.\n\nThese tariffs are fiscal levers. Traditional protectionist measures to disadvantage foreign producers and stimulate local manufacturing.\n\nThe tariffs placed on aluminium and steel, which angered Australia this week, fit into this category.\n\nLoading...The second type of tariff is designed to pressure world leaders to bend to Trump's will.\n\nRather than fiscal levers, these tariffs are bargaining chips — or, in some cases, bludgeoning clubs.\n\nAn example is Trump's snap decision to slap tariffs on Colombia.\n\nWhen that country's president refused to accept military plane-loads of handcuffed deportees, Trump said he was immediately imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Colombian imports, with more to come.\n\nColombia's president talked tough, but up against the threat of a crippled national economy, he ultimately relented.\n\n## Trade power plays\n\nSome of the tariffs appear to straddle both categories. It's not always clear what is protectionism, and what is power playing.\n\nThat could be said of the tariffs on America's biggest trading partners — China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump has complained about uneven trade relationships with those countries, and talked about tariffs as a way to reverse the deficits.\n\nBut most of his rhetoric, and the official White House orders, say he's using those tariffs to force the three countries to do more about fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\nWhen they were imposed, China responded with retaliatory tariffs. But Canada and Mexico played ball, announcing measures to toughen up border controls.\n\nSo Trump postponed their tariffs — then implemented them (with some exclusions) a month later, and told both countries to expect more.\n\nCanada's now accusing him of using the tariffs to cripple its economy to a point where the US could take over the country.\n\nIndeed, Trump posted this week: \"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished fifty-first state.\"\n\nLoading...His treatment of Canada has led to sweeping retaliatory tariffs that will hurt American exporters.\n\nChina's revenge tariffs on meat, grains and fruit won't be good for stateside farmers.\n\nMexico says it will retaliate too, but its plans aren't yet clear.\n\n## A bruising battle\n\nIn this America-versus-the-world trade war, much of the world is aggressively fighting back.\n\nAnd in the US, the bruises are becoming visible.\n\nIn response to widespread investor uncertainty and tariff-fuelled fears of recession, American stocks have tanked (dragging Australia's down with them).\n\nFor American consumers, the cost-of-living impacts are coming into view too.\n\nSome breweries, for example, are talking about having to increase their prices to cover costlier cans made from imported aluminium.\n\nThat's small beer, though, compared to the price increases on European alcohol if Trump follows through on his threat of 200 per cent tariffs on drinks from the European Union (EU) — a response to the EU's retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey.\n\nOf course, the cost increases caused by tariffs will be felt well beyond bars and bottle shops.\n\nThe metal tariffs alone have prompted warnings of price increases from industries ranging from car-making to construction.\n\n## Confidence crashes\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in November last year, there were celebrations among those Americans who told us they were worried about the economy.\n\nThe University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey — which measures how Americans feel about their finances and broader economic conditions — showed bumps in optimism in the couple of months after the election.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, though, the sentiment started to turn.\n\nThen on Friday, it crashed.\n\nThe fall to a score of 57.9 represents an 11 per cent drop in a month, to a level significantly lower than even the darkest days of COVID (but still higher than during points of rampant inflation in 2022 and 2023).\n\nOn this measure, a sizeable chunk of Americans look to be losing faith in the president they trusted to bring them boomtimes.\n\nLoading...Polls had already been reflecting widespread worries about hip-pocket hits.\n\nIn a Reuters/Ipsos poll, released on Wednesday, local time, 70 per cent of Americans said they expected tariffs would push up grocery costs and other consumer prices. Fifty-seven per cent felt his moves to shake up the economy were too erratic. Only 32 per cent approved of the job he was doing on cost-of-living issues.\n\nFor now, though, Trump is unfazed. He sees his tariffs fight as a longer-term project to right the world's wrongs and make things fairer for America.\n\nHis administration continues to argue — against the views of many economists — that the pros will outweigh the cons.\n\n\"We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore,\" Trump said earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm not going to bend at all.\"\n\nLoading",
