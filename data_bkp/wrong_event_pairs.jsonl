The epicenter was near Sagaing and Mandalay. Violent shaking was felt by millions, and the USGS issued a Red alert, predicting high casualties and extensive damage. Liquefaction and landslides were triggered. Buildings collapsed in Mandalay and roads buckled in Naypyidaw. Over 1,000 deaths and 2,400 injuries were reported initially. National phone and internet infrastructure was disrupted. Approximately 2,970 residential buildings, 150 religious structures, 30 roads, and 7 bridges were destroyed or severely damaged. Many mosques and monasteries collapsed, resulting in deaths during prayer time and trapping monks. Mandalay was severely affected, with at least 674 deaths and over 1,000 missing and more than half of the city’s buildings severely damaged or destroyed. Significant damage occurred to Mandalay University, the Dokhtawaddy Bridge, Mandalay Palace and Sagaing Township experienced widespread structural failure. In Naypyidaw, 204 fatalities were confirmed, with damage to government buildings and the airport control tower. In Shan State, at least 60 deaths were reported. In Bago Region, school and shelter collapses caused fatalities. Yangon experienced limited damage. In Thailand, at least 10 people were killed, 68 injured and 90 missing, with building collapses in Bangkok and suspension of transit and trading. On March 31, the death toll rose to over 2,900 in Myanmar and 18 in Thailand. By April 3, the death toll reached 4,390 in Myanmar and 36 in Thailand, with over 5,490 injured and hundreds missing. States of emergency were declared.\n", "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar in Mandalay at 6.21am GMT, originating at a shallow depth of 10km. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse and roads to buckle in Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a climbing death toll. The quake occurred due to strike-slip faulting on the Sagaing fault between the India and Eurasia plates. The Indian plate moved north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate. The region has experienced similar large earthquakes in the past. The moment magnitude scale is used to measure the earthquake, which is logarithmic. A large aftershock occurred, and more are expected, posing challenges to rescuers. The China Earthquake Networks Center reported the earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China's Yunnan province.\n", "A 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar on Friday, causing damage. The Mandalay General Hospital is full and no longer admitting patients, and is without power and water. The earthquake was caused by a rupture lasting a full minute, causing sideways movements.

Bangkok is vulnerable to tremors due to its tall buildings.\n", "An earthquake struck Myanmar, prompting a rare plea for international humanitarian aid from the military government. The military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, stated their willingness to cooperate with the international community. Myanmar faces challenges in aid delivery due to its isolation since the 2021 coup and prior sanctions. The UN is mobilizing aid, but logistical hurdles remain due to the ongoing civil war. Michael Martin highlights security risks for aid workers and potential military interference, including preventing access to rebel areas and manipulating aid distribution. Stefan Dercon points out challenges in transferring funds and logistical complexities. Fundraising may also be difficult due to Myanmar's isolation. The extent of U.S. government aid is uncertain.\n", "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, followed by multiple aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7. The earthquake's epicenter was located in Mandalay at a depth of 10 kilometers. Tremors were felt in China, Thailand, Vietnam, and parts of India. In Myanmar, at least 144 deaths and over 732 injuries were reported. A mosque in Taungnoo partially collapsed, killing at least 3. The Mahamuni Buddha Temple and the former royal palace in Mandalay were damaged. Myanmar's military leader appealed for international aid. India sent 15 tonnes of relief material. A state of emergency was declared in several regions.\n\nIn Thailand, a skyscraper under construction collapsed in Bangkok, resulting in at least 10 deaths, 16 injuries, and over 100 missing.

Trump argues tariffs will balance the economic playing field and encourage domestic manufacturing. Economists generally believe tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and retaliatory tariffs. Trump wants to use tariffs to force other countries to lower their tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and on imported autos and auto parts. The specifics of the tariffs to be announced on April 2 remain unclear. Negotiations with Canada are possible. The U.S. has a trade deficit. Trump believes this proves the U.S. is treated unfairly. Tariffs could pull more business into the U.S. or lead to a recession.\n", "President Trump admires the Gilded Age (1870-1913), particularly President William McKinley's era, due to its high tariffs. Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n", "Prior to last year's American election, voters frequently cited \"the economy\" as their top motivator. Now, eight weeks into Trump's presidency, \"chaos\", \"uncertainty\" and a possible \"recession\" are dominating economic discussions due to Trump's tariffs policy. Trump is using tariffs to advance his \"America First\" trade policy and to pressure world leaders. Tariffs were placed on aluminium and steel, angering Australia. Trump imposed tariffs on Colombia when its president refused to accept deportees, leading to the country's compliance. Trump has complained about uneven trade relationships with China, Canada, and Mexico, using tariffs to address trade deficits, fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration. China responded with retaliatory tariffs, while Canada and Mexico initially toughened border controls. Trump postponed, then implemented tariffs on Canada and Mexico, leading to accusations of crippling Canada's economy. Canada, China and Mexico have imposed retaliatory tariffs. Investor uncertainty and tariff-fuelled recession fears have caused American stocks to decline. Some businesses are increasing prices, and significant price increases are expected on European alcohol.
