Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

The shooting involved a gun, rare in Japan due to stringent firearm laws. Gun violence is almost unheard-of in Japan, with only one firearm-related death in 2021. The shooter used a handmade gun, which was seized along with several others at his home. Japan's firearms laws are strict, requiring a 12-step process to purchase a gun. Political assassinations were common before WWII, but rare since; the last killing of a national political figure was in 1960. Light police protection at political events allowed the shooter unobstructed access. The incident has shocked Japan and raised questions about the country's safety and political future.\n"}

Musk has begun tempering his initial goal of cutting $2 trillion in federal spending. Trump named Musk and Ramaswamy as DOGE's co-leaders to identify government waste for the White House Office of Management and Budget to cut. DOGE has received numerous applications through X. Steve Davis is helping oversee the effort, and Emil Michael is overseeing regulation cuts. Katie Miller and Bill McGinley were also appointed to DOGE. Questions remain about DOGE's authority and responsibilities, and whether it has Trump's full backing.\n"}

The plan includes a 10% \"base line\" tariff on nearly all U.S. imports (excluding Canada and Mexico) and a \"reciprocal\" tariff (1-40%, added to the 10% base) on 57 countries with allegedly unfair trade practices, calculated based on the U.S. trade deficit. The 10% tariffs will take effect on Saturday, the reciprocal rates the following Wednesday. Affected countries include China, Japan, Germany, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam; European goods will face a 20 percent tariff, Japanese goods will face 24 percent and South Korean products 26 percent. Chinese exports face an extra 34 percent tariff, potentially reaching 79% on some products. Vietnam will face a 46 percent tariff. Trump aims to force companies to manufacture in the U.S., creating jobs. The tariffs will increase costs for importers, potentially passed on to consumers. The government anticipates increased revenue to channel into tax cuts. The announcement triggered a global stock market decline; retaliation from other countries is possible, potentially sparking trade wars.

Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n"}

Trump postponed, then implemented tariffs on Canada and Mexico, leading to accusations of crippling Canada's economy. Canada, China and Mexico have imposed retaliatory tariffs.
