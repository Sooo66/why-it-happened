The model considers the local government's positive implementation of relocation (\\(a\\)) and resettlers' voluntary migration (\\(b\\)), along with rate, auxiliary, and external variables.\n\nNumerical simulation, using data from the Qianping Reservoir resettlement case, shows that initial willingness affects the stable state. In Scenario 1, initial willingness of \\(a = 0.9,b = 0.9\\) leads to stabilization at \\(E_{a} (0,0)\\), while in Scenario 2, initial willingness of \\(a = 0.1,b = 0.1\\) leads to stabilization at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). Adjusting the initial probability of the local government's willingness toward positive implementation increases the number of iterations required for resettlers to reach the evolutionary steady state, but both parties ultimately tend to adopt a negative strategic choice. Conversely, adjusting the probability of resettlers' voluntary migration has minimal effect on the strategic choices of the local government.\n\nNumerical sensitivity analysis examines the impact of variables. Higher costs associated with passive implementation by the local government lead to favouring active policy implementation, with little impact on resettlers. Increased rewards for due diligence lead the local government to slow down the rate of passive implementation. Decreasing the reference value of the payment account (\\(U_{1}\\)) leads the local government to transition to active implementation, while decreasing the reference value of the gain account (\\(U_{2}\\)) shifts resettlers from involuntary to voluntary migration. Increased price increases to address social disorder with involuntary resettlers leads to a faster rate of convergence towards a stable state under passive participation. Synergistic gains from cooperation lead to more active implementation of resettlement programmes and more willingness of migrant groups to migrate voluntarily.\n\nAnalysis of the system feedback structure reveals a mutually reinforcing cycle between the local government's \"active implementation\" and resettlers' \"voluntary participation\" (D), converging towards \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\).

Simultaneously, China faced \"China+1\" strategy headwinds as countries diversified supply chains. India should aim to be a more reliable trading partner. Trump has called India the \"tariff king.\" Krugman labeled Trump's tariffs the \"biggest trade shock in history.\" These tariffs are leading to retaliation and accelerating trade partnership negotiations excluding the U.S. Economic uncertainty has increased. Demand-side diversification away from the U.S. is occurring, and supply chains are diversifying away from China. China has weaponized trade and faces anti-dumping duties. India's tariffs rose between 2015 and 2022. India's tariffs are higher than competitors. Post-2022, India saw a rise in quality control orders. After 1947, India opted for import substitution industrialization. Post-1991, India liberalized trade policies. Vietnam exports more manufactured goods than India. India's tariff regime has hindered comprehensive free trade agreements. Trump announced a tariff rate on India on April 2. India hopes a bilateral trade agreement will help it sidestep the tariffs. On May 6, India and the U.K. concluded talks on an FTA. Countries seek reliable sources of supply and demand.\n"}
{"uuid": "997abe01-733f-4167-a913-36af44644fa4", "summary": "International trade is undergoing a reset as major countries shift towards protectionism. This shift follows a move towards \"deep trade\" agreements that regulate domestic policy beyond tariff barriers. Protectionist forces are challenging open trade, with advanced economies blaming trade for job losses. The US is adopting protectionist measures. The rise in trade agreements and exports since the 1990s were managed away from public attention, but trade negotiations are now political. Nations are pursuing \"worker-centered\" trade deals, \"friend-shoring,\" and supply chain diversification due to China's influence and the need to modernize manufacturing. Labor-intensive industries are moving to emerging economies, while digital trade favors Western economies. The WTO's influence is declining due to disputes and members retaining \"developing economies\" status. Economies are pivoting to protectionism and preferential trade agreements (PTAs) like USMCA, CPTPP, AfCFTA, and RCEP, excluding major traders like China, the US, and the EU from agreements with each other. Interdependence is evident in trade data, but COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities. The reset needs new priorities, including geopolitical interests, climate and energy security, digital economy regulations, and diversified supply chains.\n"}

Trump's tariff protectionism is an unprecedented shock, risking the post-WWII non-discrimination system. Mario Draghi cited the danger of higher US tariffs redirecting Chinese overcapacity to Europe, harming European firms. China's exports are growing rapidly, exceeding its GDP threshold. German industry is losing market share. Chinese manufacturers are preparing to reduce profit margins and conquer other markets due to falling US sales.\n"}

{"uuid": "7fa3b515-7d0c-46c7-92e2-a88c6897d53d", "summary": "President Trump's tariff policies harmed the US economy, failing to achieve intended goals. Tariffs functioned as taxes on American consumers, raising costs. In 2019, initial tariffs increased household costs by approximately $831 annually. In 2025, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on nearly all imports, escalating consumer prices. Retaliatory tariffs harmed U.S. exporters, particularly agriculture, with China's tariffs causing over $10 billion in annual losses for farmers. The manufacturing sector declined in industries dependent on imported components. Trump's tariff approach deterred business investment and slowed economic growth. The U.S. trade deficit widened during Trump's administration. Trump's stance damaged relationships with trading partners. Policymakers should reject Trump's protectionist approach and return to international trade practices.\n"}
{"uuid": "35f507a2-a692-46ab-b057-088832b48e19", "summary": "The US administration is imposing 25% automotive tariffs under Section 232, starting April 3, affecting imported passenger vehicles and key automobile parts. The administration is also ending duty-free de minimis treatment for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, subjecting them to duties. These tariffs could cause a 0.3-0.4% GDP loss in the US and 0.1-0.4% GDP loss in the EU, Canada, Mexico and Japan, and a potential recession in the second half of the year with a real GDP growth drag averaging 0.8ppt in 2025, and a rise in US consumer price inflation by 0.8ppt by Q4 2025. The likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to around 60%. The Fed is expected to maintain a reactionary stance. Uncertainty surrounds the breadth and duration of tariffs, but negotiations to lower them are anticipated. Tariffs will undermine corporate and household sentiment, potentially leading to reduced spending and investment. Businesses will diversify supply chains or invest in automation. The long-term impact on US real GDP is expected to be -0.7%.\n"}
