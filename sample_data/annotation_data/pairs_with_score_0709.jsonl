Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.
