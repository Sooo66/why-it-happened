They are outside of the EU and therefore also outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Thus these exchanges should not be affected by Brexit. The UK government is proud of what Theresa May has referred to as its “unique intelligence capabilities.” These stem from its traditional, close partnership with the U.S. and its membership in the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance of Anglosphere nations. No other European countries, including France and Germany, have the capability and reach of the UK, especially in the field of digital intelligence.28\n\nBritain also has a prime role in counter terrorism policy in Europe. The UK drafted the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy in 2005, which is modeled on the British national strategy. At the legislative level, the UK has strongly influenced some important EU initiatives such as the Europol Counter Terrorism Centre (CTC) and the PNRD.29 The UK has also taken the lead with its intelligence-led counter terrorism policing concept. This integrates the intelligence agencies with the police in order to start investigations into terrorist plots as early as possible in the attack cycle.30 The intelligence and police functions are normally kept separate in continental Europe, which can limit the timely exchange of vital information and slow down the investigation process. However, the UK has definitely benefitted from EU counter terrorism activities and agencies. The EAW, for instance, has greatly increased the speed of extraditions between EU states. Cases that previously took months or years are now resolved in weeks. Europol is valuable for police liaison and cooperation and Eurojust plays the same role for judicial cooperation. Britain has also joined the Schengen Information System, which allows police to share information on suspects and provides a network for sharing DNA, fingerprints, and vehicle registration documentation.31\n\nThere is no evidence that the referendum decision has had a negative impact on the UK’s counter-terrorism activities, at least so far. It is assumed that EU states will wish to continue close counter terrorism cooperation with the UK after Brexit, while Britain will also want to retain access to EU law enforcement databases and data-sharing platforms. The UK will presumably remain a member of the Counter Terrorist Group (CTG). CTG is a non-EU body where the heads of intelligence agencies of EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland meet to encourage members to share intelligence and facilitate operational cooperation. But this informal group is not yet a substitute for direct cooperation through the EU agencies identified above.\n\nAfter Brexit, the UK will have to negotiate new arrangements for all of these, possibly through a series of bilateral sharing agreements with individual states. Australia and the U.S., for example, have association agreements that allow them to have liaison officers at Europol. Nevertheless, officials acknowledge that there will be some practical limits on what can be achieved in comparison to the pre-Brexit situation. At the moment, there is no precedent for a non-EU country to plug directly into the Europol information system and the legislative framework for the EAW exists under ECJ jurisdiction that the UK will leave.32 The negotiation process, even if conducted with a mind to mutual security benefits, will at the very least hinder Britain and Europe’s efforts to create more powerful and mutually beneficial networks to fight terrorism. Sir Julian King, the EU Commissioner for Security Union, put the issue succinctly: “Because everybody agrees that you should do something does not mean that it is necessarily straightforward and easy to do…”33\n\nBritish government negotiators will be focused on trying to retain all the benefits of close counter terrorism cooperation with continental Europe. Meanwhile the government may face a renewed terrorism threat on another flank as the Brexit decision could exacerbate tensions in Northern Ireland. The UK government assesses the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland as “severe” and low level attacks by republican fringe groups have continued unabated despite the peace agreement signed in 2007. Up to 80% of the republican Sinn Fein supporters and other nationalists are believed to have voted for Remain.34 The potential renegotiation of the Common Travel Area Agreement, which could affect the current open border with the Republic of Ireland, and the loss of EU funding for Northern Ireland infrastructure projects, may increase nationalist sentiment. These developments may encourage violent republican dissidents to step up their campaign if they can build the necessary grassroots support. This was evidently lacking when such groups tried to exploit the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, but the complexities and uncertainties associated with Brexit in Northern Ireland may yet provide the support for renewed violence that has hitherto been absent.",

And I made clear the Referendum was about this and this alone - not the future of any single politician including myself. But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination. This is not a decision I’ve taken lightly but I do believe it’s in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required. There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October. Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months.

But Northern Ireland and Scotland voted in favor of remaining, raising the specter that the United Kingdom itself may break apart.\n\nCameron announced he will resign before his Conservative Party conference in October.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union,\" Cameron said Friday. \"But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\"\n\nThe process of leaving the EU will likely take many years of negotiations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Dunham/AP Matt Dunham/AP\n\nIn the meantime, it's a period of \"tremendous uncertainty\" for the U.K. and Europe, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from London. And the fiery rhetoric that marked the debate over the referendum hasn't ended now that the results are in.\n\n\"The EU's failing, the EU's dying,\" said Leave campaigner Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, after the official results were announced. Farage said he anticipates the Netherlands and Denmark will follow Great Britain out of the European Union.\n\nThe value of the British pound plunged; at one point Friday it was lower against the U.S. dollar than it has been at any point since 1985.\n\nGlobal stock markets also plummeted as the vote counts trickled in Thursday night and Friday morning. NPR's John Ydstie notes, however, that markets had been up based on the erroneous belief that the U.K. would opt for \"remain\" — so the sharp decline actually returns markets to approximately where they were a week ago. Gold, meanwhile, went up.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn U.K., Elation, Surprise And Uncertainty\n\nOpinion polls showed a tight race, with the final poll — as well as the betting markets and the financial world — anticipating the U.K. would vote \"Remain.\" That meant for many in the U.K. and around the world, the referendum's outcome came as a shock.\n\nThe results showed sharp regional divisions in the United Kingdom. London, Scotland and Northern Ireland had strong pro-EU results, while rural and economically depressed areas backed the so-called Brexit in large numbers.\n\ntoggle caption Rob Stothard/Getty Images\n\nNPR's Frank Langfitt says that in London today, people who wanted to remain in the EU are both disappointed and \"very surprised.\"\n\n\"People who wanted out are elated,\" he said. \"There's one woman I talked to who actually screamed.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said voters were reacting to decades of mistreatment by successive governments.\n\n\"Many communities are fed up with cuts, fed up with economic dislocation and feel very angry at the way they've been betrayed and marginalized,\" Corbyn said.\n\nAnger over immigration was a potent force among the \"Leave\" camp, Frank says.\n\nMany voters who opted out of the EU \"felt that the price of immigration was just too high, that it was driving down wages, costing people jobs,\" he says. \"With some white Britons, there was a feeling also that the immigration was changing the nature of communities here.\"\n\ntoggle caption Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany voters also distrusted the experts and powerful leaders urging voters against the Brexit, Frank says:\n\n\"The rest of the world, for what it's worth, was telling the Brits not to do this. Economists almost uniformly were against this; they said it would damage the British economy and the global economy. Political leaders from Xi Jinping in China to Barack Obama said this would make Britain less relevant. But the voters — to some degree, I think, tired of being told what to do by the elites — made up their minds.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs U.K. Breaks Off, Might It Break Apart?\n\nNorthern Ireland's strong Remain vote led Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney to call for a referendum on unification with Ireland, an EU member country. Sinn Fein is the largest Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland's deputy first minister, nationalist Martin McGuinness, said holding such a vote is \"a democratic imperative.\"\n\nPro-British First Minister Arlene Foster, meanwhile, said there was \"no way\" such a vote would result in a united Ireland.\n\nScotland, too, may be eyeing a split with the U.K. — again. A 2014 referendum on Scottish independence resulted in the country remaining within the United Kingdom.\n\nBut now that the U.K. will be leaving the EU, a second referendum may be in the works. Scotland's voters preferred \"Remain\" over \"Leave,\" by 62 percent to 38 percent.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the result is Scotland being pulled out of Europe against its will.\n\n\"I regard that as being democratically unacceptable,\" she said Friday. \"It's a statement of the obvious that a second referendum [on independence] is on the table.\"\n\nIn Europe, 'Complete Shock'\n\nThe United Kingdom is (or was, until the pound crashed) the second-largest economy in the EU, and the referendum comes as a blow to the continent.\n\n\"I think there was complete shock this morning when people woke up,\" says NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, reporting from Berlin. \"Like most Europeans, everybody here thought they would wake up to the U.K. still being in the EU.\n\n\"It's unusual here to have a quick reaction from officialdom, but there actually was some reaction,\" she says. \"The vice chancellor I think summed it up for all when he tweeted, 'Damn, a bad day for Europe.' \"\n\nCurrent EU president Donald Tusk said the group is \"determined to keep our unity at 27,\" referring to the number of member nations minus Great Britain. He went on to say, quoting his father, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\"\n\nThe EU assembly will hold an emergency session next week in the wake of the news, The Associated Press reports. The referendum's results will also be the top item on the agenda for an upcoming summit of EU leaders in Brussels.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGermany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, tweeted the vote was \"a sad day for Europe and Britain.\" France's foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said he was \"sad for the United Kingdom.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPoland's foreign ministry, meanwhile, called it a \"warning signal\" of \"disillusionment with European integration,\" the AP reports. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, said the vote pivoted on the question of immigration and signaled the importance of Brussels listening to the \"voice of the people\" in member states. Anti-immigration sentiment has been playing a central role in politics within both countries.\n\nEuroskeptic parties in Sweden and Denmark called for EU membership referenda in their own nations, the AP writes, as did far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France.\n\nAs for what happens next: NPR's Peter Kenyon explains there is a two-year window for the U.K. and the EU to come to an agreement over the terms of its departure from Europe.\n\nAs Peter noted earlier, some members of the \"Remain\" camp have worried that a Brexit would give the EU an incentive to keep other member states from fleeing: \"Therefore, the argument goes, they would offer the U.K. very poor exit terms — such as drastically limiting the U.K.'s access to the EU single market — as a warning to other states.\"\n\ntoggle caption Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn U.S., Economic Effects And Political Echoes\n\nWhile laws and policies in the U.K. aren't changing immediately, the impact of the Brexit on the rest of the world, including the U.S., has already begun.\n\nThe British pound is one of the world's stable \"reserve\" currencies, and it's fallen precipitously in value. Markets, too, have contracted. On Friday morning, the Dow opened and immediately dropped approximately 500 points.\n\n\"I think over the long term for the United States, it's going to mean a little bit slower economy,\" reports NPR's John Ydstie. \"It means a stronger dollar, which is going to hurt exports.

Votes To Leave EU ; Prime Minister Cameron To Step Down Enlarge this image toggle caption Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images Updated 9:42 a.m . ET Voters in the U.K. have decided to leave the European Union , a decision that has shocked Europe , shaken global markets and pushed Prime Minister David Cameron to announce his upcoming resignation . The EU referendum vote was decisive — 52 percent to 48 percent in favor of dissolving the United Kingdom 's 43-year membership in the European community . But Northern Ireland and Scotland voted in favor of remaining , raising the specter that the United Kingdom itself may break apart . Cameron announced he will resign before his Conservative Party conference in October . Sponsor Message '' I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger , safer and better off inside the European Union , '' Cameron said Friday . `` But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path , and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction . '' The process of leaving the EU will likely take many years of negotiations . Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Dunham/AP Matt Dunham/AP In the meantime , it 's a period of `` tremendous uncertainty '' for the U.K. and Europe , NPR 's Peter Kenyon reports from London . And the fiery rhetoric that marked the debate over the referendum has n't ended now that the results are in . `` The EU 's failing , the EU 's dying , '' said Leave campaigner Nigel Farage , the head of the U.K . Independence Party , after the official results were announced . Farage said he anticipates the Netherlands and Denmark will follow Great Britain out of the European Union . The value of the British pound plunged ; at one point Friday it was lower against the U.S. dollar than it has been at any point since 1985 . Global stock markets also plummeted as the vote counts trickled in Thursday night and Friday morning . NPR 's John Ydstie notes , however , that markets had been up based on the erroneous belief that the U.K. would opt for `` remain '' — so the sharp decline actually returns markets to approximately where they were a week ago . Gold , meanwhile , went up . Sponsor Message In U.K. , Elation , Surprise And Uncertainty Opinion polls showed a tight race , with the final poll — as well as the betting markets and the financial world — anticipating the U.K. would vote `` Remain . '' That meant for many in the U.K. and around the world , the referendum 's outcome came as a shock . The results showed sharp regional divisions in the United Kingdom . London , Scotland and Northern Ireland had strong pro-EU results , while rural and economically depressed areas backed the so-called Brexit in large numbers . toggle caption Rob Stothard/Getty Images NPR 's Frank Langfitt says that in London today , people who wanted to remain in the EU are both disappointed and `` very surprised . '' `` People who wanted out are elated , '' he said . `` There 's one woman I talked to who actually screamed . '' Jeremy Corbyn , leader of the opposition Labour Party , said voters were reacting to decades of mistreatment by successive governments . `` Many communities are fed up with cuts , fed up with economic dislocation and feel very angry at the way they 've been betrayed and marginalized , '' Corbyn said . Anger over immigration was a potent force among the `` Leave '' camp , Frank says . Many voters who opted out of the EU `` felt that the price of immigration was just too high , that it was driving down wages , costing people jobs , '' he says . `` With some white Britons , there was a feeling also that the immigration was changing the nature of communities here . '' toggle caption Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images Many voters also distrusted the experts and powerful leaders urging voters against the Brexit , Frank says : '' The rest of the world , for what it 's worth , was telling the Brits not to do this . Economists almost uniformly were against this ; they said it would damage the British economy and the global economy . Political leaders from Xi Jinping in China to Barack Obama said this would make Britain less relevant . But the voters — to some degree , I think , tired of being told what to do by the elites — made up their minds . '' Sponsor Message As U.K . Breaks Off , Might It Break Apart ? Northern Ireland 's strong Remain vote led Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney to call for a referendum on unification with Ireland , an EU member country . Sinn Fein is the largest Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland . Northern Ireland 's deputy first minister , nationalist Martin McGuinness , said holding such a vote is `` a democratic imperative . '' Pro-British First Minister Arlene Foster , meanwhile , said there was `` no way '' such a vote would result in a united Ireland . Scotland , too , may be eyeing a split with the U.K. — again . A 2014 referendum on Scottish independence resulted in the country remaining within the United Kingdom . But now that the U.K. will be leaving the EU , a second referendum may be in the works . Scotland 's voters preferred `` Remain '' over `` Leave , '' by 62 percent to 38 percent . Enlarge this image toggle caption Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the result is Scotland being pulled out of Europe against its will . `` I regard that as being democratically unacceptable , '' she said Friday . `` It 's a statement of the obvious that a second referendum [ on independence ] is on the table . '' In Europe , 'Complete Shock ' The United Kingdom is ( or was , until the pound crashed ) the second-largest economy in the EU , and the referendum comes as a blow to the continent . `` I think there was complete shock this morning when people woke up , '' says NPR 's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson , reporting from Berlin . `` Like most Europeans , everybody here thought they would wake up to the U.K. still being in the EU . `` It 's unusual here to have a quick reaction from officialdom , but there actually was some reaction , '' she says . `` The vice chancellor I think summed it up for all when he tweeted , 'Damn , a bad day for Europe . ' `` Current EU president Donald Tusk said the group is `` determined to keep our unity at 27 , '' referring to the number of member nations minus Great Britain . He went on to say , quoting his father , `` What does n't kill you makes you stronger . '' The EU assembly will hold an emergency session next week in the wake of the news , The Associated Press reports . The referendum 's results will also be the top item on the agenda for an upcoming summit of EU leaders in Brussels . Sponsor Message Germany 's foreign minister , Frank-Walter Steinmeier , tweeted the vote was `` a sad day for Europe and Britain . '' France 's foreign minister , Jean-Marc Ayrault , said he was `` sad for the United Kingdom . '' Enlarge this image toggle caption Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images Poland 's foreign ministry , meanwhile , called it a `` warning signal '' of `` disillusionment with European integration , '' the AP reports . Hungary 's prime minister , Viktor Orban , said the vote pivoted on the question of immigration and signaled the importance of Brussels listening to the `` voice of the people '' in member states . Anti-immigration sentiment has been playing a central role in politics within both countries . Euroskeptic parties in Sweden and Denmark called for EU membership referenda in their own nations , the AP writes , as did far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France . As for what happens next : NPR 's Peter Kenyon explains there is a two-year window for the U.K. and the EU to come to an agreement over the terms of its departure from Europe . As Peter noted earlier , some members of the `` Remain '' camp have worried that a Brexit would give the EU an incentive to keep other member states from fleeing : `` Therefore , the argument goes , they would offer the U.K. very poor exit terms — such as drastically limiting the U.K. 's access to the EU single market — as a warning to other states . '' toggle caption Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images In U.S. , Economic Effects And Political Echoes While laws and policies in the U.K. are n't changing immediately , the impact of the Brexit on the rest of the world , including the U.S. , has already begun . The British pound is one of the world 's stable `` reserve '' currencies , and it 's fallen precipitously in value . Markets , too , have contracted . On Friday morning , the Dow opened and immediately dropped approximately 500 points . `` I think over the long term for the United States , it 's going to mean a little bit slower economy , '' reports NPR 's John Ydstie . `` It means a stronger dollar , which is going to hurt exports . It also means that our trading partners , like the EU and the U.K. , are going to go through a period of uncertainty and their growth could be hampered — so , again , exports to those countries could be hurt . '' Sponsor Message As NPR 's Marilyn Geewax has previously reported , there 's also the risk of a domino effect of exits — whether Scotland leaving the U.K. or more countries leaving the EU .

Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started.

        "content": "Go here to follow CNN’s coverage of the UK referendum live.\n\nStory highlights Markets plunged at the news Scotland may hold an independence referendum Some parties in other countries call for an EU vote\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThe United Kingdom’s historic Brexit vote to leave the European Union triggered the resignation Friday of British Prime Minister David Cameron and wreaked havoc on global markets.\n\nThere was a mixture of jubilation and tearful disbelief in the UK as people awoke to the final result from Thursday’s extremely close vote, which deeply divided the nation.\n\nThe result plunged Europe into uncertainty, with calls for further referendums from emboldened far-right groups who see it as a boost for their anti-EU, anti-immigration policies.\n\nIt also reverberated across financial markets, causing huge losses in Asia, Europe and the United States as traders weighed the consequences for the world’s biggest economic zone.\n\nA map of the United Kingdom, which shows the areas that voted to remain in blue, and those which voted to leave in red.\n\nWithin hours of Thursday’s ballot outcome – 51.89% in favor of leaving the EU and 48.11% against – Cameron delivered an emotionally charged statement outside the Prime Minister’s residence at 10 Downing Street, announcing his intention to stand down.\n\nMORE: What happens now?\n\nCameron’s possible successor\n\n“The British people have voted to leave the EU and their will must be respected,” he said. “The will of the British people is an instruction which must be delivered. … There can be no doubt about the result.”\n\nCameron gave no timetable for his departure but said he wanted a new leader to be in place by October, when his Conservative Party holds its annual conference.\n\nHe said the country needed a pro-exit leader to steer it out of the EU, an organization it has been a part of since 1973. That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one.

Story highlights Markets plunged at the news Scotland may hold an independence referendum Some parties in other countries call for an EU vote London CNN — The United Kingdom ’ s historic Brexit vote to leave the European Union triggered the resignation Friday of British Prime Minister David Cameron and wreaked havoc on global markets . There was a mixture of jubilation and tearful disbelief in the UK as people awoke to the final result from Thursday ’ s extremely close vote , which deeply divided the nation . The result plunged Europe into uncertainty , with calls for further referendums from emboldened far-right groups who see it as a boost for their anti-EU , anti-immigration policies . It also reverberated across financial markets , causing huge losses in Asia , Europe and the United States as traders weighed the consequences for the world ’ s biggest economic zone . A map of the United Kingdom , which shows the areas that voted to remain in blue , and those which voted to leave in red . Within hours of Thursday ’ s ballot outcome – 51.89 % in favor of leaving the EU and 48.11 % against – Cameron delivered an emotionally charged statement outside the Prime Minister ’ s residence at 10 Downing Street , announcing his intention to stand down . MORE : What happens now ? Cameron ’ s possible successor “ The British people have voted to leave the EU and their will must be respected , ” he said . “ The will of the British people is an instruction which must be delivered . … There can be no doubt about the result. ” Cameron gave no timetable for his departure but said he wanted a new leader to be in place by October , when his Conservative Party holds its annual conference . He said the country needed a pro-exit leader to steer it out of the EU , an organization it has been a part of since 1973 . That process could take at least two years . Boris Johnson , the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK ’ s departure from the EU , is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron ’ s likely successor . Johnson , who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning , thanked voters for their decision , pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity . “ I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can , ” he said . “ They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote. ” Former PM : There will be costs Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN ’ s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles , ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way . “ I literally can not think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe , ” Blair said . “ There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers. ” Blair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing , brought on by economic turmoil , globalization and anger at immigration . “ Getting out of Europe is not the answer , ” he said , noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU . “ We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand. ” Possible Scottish independence vote In Scotland , where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU , Nicola Sturgeon , Scotland ’ s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party , said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country ’ s place in the UK . She said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one . Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014 . “ Democratically unacceptable , ” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in .

Voters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU . Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK .

The EU is an economic and political partnership between 28 member nations committed to the prosperity of the region as a whole. Britain joined the European Economic Community, which would later be absorbed into the EU, in 1973 and has been a valuable contributing member since.\n\nBut in recent years, anti-European rumblings have become more pronounced in the country.\n\nIn 2013, in response to public outcries and increasing pressure from members of Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on the U.K.'s membership in the European Union if his Conservative Party won the next election. The party won, and Cameron made good on his commitment when the June 23 date was set in February.\n\nCameron laid out a plan in late 2015 that attempted to change the terms of the U.K.'s membership in the EU without leaving the group. His efforts fell short in a deal that was finalized with EU leaders in early 2016, and \"Brexit\" – a splice of \"Britain\" and \"exit\" – was born. The nation has since divided itself into the \"remain\" camp – including Cameron and former Prime Minister Tony Blair – and the \"leave\" camp – including former London Mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nThe decision that faces U.K. citizens is a political, economic and emotional one, shrouded by uncertain outcomes and largely without precedence (the U.K. held a similar referendum vote in 1975, but 67 percent of citizens voted to stay). Here are a few charts that explain what is known about Brexit and the U.K.'s relationship with the EU.\n\nThe EU represents 508 million people from 28 member states. The nations cumulatively comprise about a fourth of the world's economic output, totaling $18.5 billion in 2014, and the U.K.'s gross domestic product accounts for about 15 percent of the EU's total product.\n\nEach member nation contributes a monthly sum to the EU's operating budget based on a tax formula in return for policies and programs that benefit the region. In pure budgetary terms, a number of countries that contribute most to the EU's operating budget stand to gain least from EU expenditures. In 2014, the U.K. gave nearly $5.5 billion more to the EU than it took from the budget, accounting for 8 percent of total national contributions, but less than 5 percent of the EU's total expenditures, according to the European Commission . Germany had an even greater negative balance – more than $17 billion after contributing 18 percent of the budget. Italy had a negative balance of $5 billion after contributing 10 percent of the budget.\n\nEU-funded initiatives in the U.K. highlighted by the European Commission include a $78 million investment in Superfast Cornwall, a commitment to connect at least 80 percent of homes and business in the rural county to \"fibre-optic superfast broadband,\" and an $8 million investment in the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine to fund the construction of new facilities for stem cell research.\n\nThe \"free movement of people is one of the EU's fundamental principles,\" according to the EU freedom of movement and residence directive passed in 2004. Nearly 3 million people from other EU countries have migrated to the U.K., according to the United Nations Population Division , and 1.2 million from the U.K. have moved elsewhere in the Union. And while the U.K. remains a member of the EU, these 4 million migrants have the \"right to move freely and live in another EU country,\" but there is no precedent as to what happens to those from a country or living in a country that removes itself from the EU.\n\nIn addition to people, goods, services and money are able to move freely within the EU's single market as if it were one country. Free trade within EU borders is supposed to mutually benefit all member nations and attract international partnerships to a large European trade bloc. U.S. President Barack Obama said that the U.K. would be at the \"back of the queue\" for a trade deal if it votes to leave the EU and that it could take a decade to negotiate a new agreement. The U.S. is currently the U.K.'s largest export destination.\n\nResults of the referendum have been tough to predict. Many polls consistently report a split of less than 5 percentage points. Generally, though, the majority of younger people and richer people say they will vote \"remain,\" while the majority of older people and poorer people say they will vote \"leave.\"\n\nThe views of other EU citizens are much clearer: they want the U.K. to remain part of the club. \"France is the only country where more than a quarter of the public says it would be positive for the EU if the UK departed,\" according to a Pew Research Center report from April. In an earlier survey of 28,000 European voters by Lord Michael Ashcroft, former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party who has become known for his political polls, only 10 percent said they would like the U.K. to leave the EU. Sixty percent of those surveyed said they would prefer the U.K. stay in the EU, and 30 percent said it didn't matter. At 24 percent, Luxembourg had the highest portion of people who said they would prefer the U.K. to leave the EU, and Lithuania had the highest portion of people that would prefer the U.K. to stay.\n\nBritish and Irish citizens who live in the U.K. and are older than 18 can vote on the referendum, as long as they registered to vote before the June 9 deadline. A record number of 525,000 applications on June 6 caused the government registration website to crash and spurred an extension of the initial June 7 deadline. More than 1 million people registered to vote in the last days before the deadline.\n\nAlso eligible to vote are British and Irish citizens living abroad who have been registered to vote for at least 15 years and Commonwealth citizens living in the U.K.\n\nIf U.K. citizens vote \"leave,\" transitioning out of the EU could effectively take years.

But pressure on the voters is much more immediate; they'll have to make up their minds before heading to the polls this week."

Stanford lecturer Christophe Crombez recommends the UK remain in the EU. (Image credit: gOd4ather / Shutterstock)\n\nSo would other European nations, and the real winners would be countries that seek to divide European unity, said Christophe Crombez, a consulting professor in Stanford’s Europe Center in the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\n\nBritain is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether the country should leave or remain in the European Union.\n\n“It would bring but an illusion of sovereignty,” said Crombez, who studies European Union politics, parliamentary systems, political economy and economic analysis of political institutions. He is an economist from Belgium.\n\nThe Stanford News Service recently interviewed Crombez on the upcoming vote, known as “Brexit.”\n\nWhat is Brexit?\n\nThe term Brexit refers to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union allows member states to withdraw.\n\nWhat are the arguments for and against Brexit?\n\nThe campaign for the UK to leave the EU uses the following main arguments: leaving would save UK taxpayers money, since the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget; the UK would no longer have to comply with EU laws it does not want, whereas currently it can be outvoted in EU institutions and forced to adopt laws it opposes; and it would allow the UK to better control migration, whereas EU citizens are currently free to move and work throughout the EU.\n\nThese three arguments can easily be refuted, however. The UK does indeed contribute to the EU budget, but the benefits it derives from being part of the EU market far outweigh the budgetary contributions. Moreover, (if Britain were to withdraw) the EU would require the UK to pay into its budget, if it wants to remain part of the EU’s internal market, as it has done with Switzerland and Norway.\n\nAlso, about half of UK exports are destined for the EU. If the UK were to leave, it would no doubt want to continue to trade with the EU. UK products would have to conform to EU rules for them to be sold in the EU. UK companies that want to export to the EU would thus continue to comply with EU rules. The difference would be that the UK would no longer be involved in setting those EU rules. Post-Brexit, the rules would thus be less to the UK’s liking than prior to it, and UK companies would comply to these less advantageous rules.\n\nFinally, the EU would impose requirements on immigration and free movement of people on the UK in exchange for free trade with the EU, as it has with other countries in similar situations, such as Norway and Switzerland. Moreover, member states may no longer feel inclined to stop refugees from moving on to the UK if the UK were to leave, which may lead to higher rather than lower immigration.\n\nIn addition to these arguments, the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign (which supports the UK remaining in the EU) argues that Britain carries more weight in world politics as part of the EU than on its own, in trade negotiations as well as on security issues, and that a united Europe is better at dealing with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and other authoritarian rulers, terrorist threats and international crime.\n\nWhat do you think is the best decision for the United Kingdom to make on this vote?\n\nI see no advantages to leaving the EU. It would bring but an illusion of sovereignty – consider the points above. The vote would have a negative impact on growth in the UK and the rest of the EU and, in fact, the world, and it would weaken the UK, the EU and the West in world politics.\n\nWhat happens economically to Britain if the country leaves the European Union?\n\nTrade and hence gross domestic product would be negatively affected, especially in the short term. Uncertainty would reduce investment and trade. The UK and the EU would be consumed with the negotiations on the break-up for years. This would prevent both the UK and EU from tackling more important economic and security issues. In the long term, the economy would readjust, but the result would be suboptimal.\n\nWhat happens to the EU if Britain leaves?\n\nThe EU is less dependent on trade with the UK than vice versa. There would be an economic impact, but it would be less substantial. The effect would be more significant for a few countries that trade more with the UK, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nBrexit would, however, deliver a major blow to the idea of European unification. It would weaken the EU impact in world politics and strengthen such rulers as Putin and (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan in their dealings with the EU.\n\nCould a British exit open up a Pandora’s Box of other EU countries exiting or spark other regional independence movements, like Catalonia?\n\nThat is quite possible. A number of other countries may want to hold referendums on the EU. Moreover, Brexit is likely to lead to a break-up of the UK. Scotland would likely hold another referendum and decide to leave the UK in order to stay in the EU. The same may be true for Northern Ireland in the long run. Scottish secession may then give other EU regions, such as Catalonia, further incentives to secede.",

        "summary": "The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23 to decide whether to leave (Brexit) or remain in the European Union (EU). Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n",

Brexit backers pledged that money the U.K. currently sends to the E.U. — supposedly £350 million ($462 million) a week — would go to the country's national health system instead.

The process looks like direct democracy in its purest form, and it was celebrated as such by many Leave campaigners after the vote. But David A. Bell, a Princeton historian writing in The New Republic four years ago as Greece was preparing for a referendum on its bailout, argues that the result of referendums is much more often anti-democratic.\n\nHe divides referendums into two categories: The first implicates fundamental questions of sovereignty (should Quebec become independent, or Scotland break away from Great Britain?). These kinds of referendums are appropriate, Bell argues: \"They represent instances when sovereign power, always ultimately held by the people, but mediated by constitutional structures, temporarily reverts to the people directly, so that they can modify or replace these structures.\"\n\nThen there are referendums about questions that would otherwise be handled by the legislatures the people have already elected:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is certainly tempting to salute this second form of referendum as a means of checking the seamy practices that too often infect modern representative systems. But however much the designers of referendums claim to be acting in the name of democratic reform, their actions usually end up undercutting democratic institutions. This tendency isn’t merely incidental — it’s unavoidable given how referendums work. First, they take relatively technical issues away from legislators who have the time and expertise to deal with them, and give them to voters who do not.\n\nReferendums also tend to make legislating in the future much harder, by casting policies as constitutional changes that are hard to dislodge. And, Bell argues, they undermine the legitimacy of legislatures by suggesting that real democracy can only come directly from the people instead.\n\nIn a world where all kinds of decisions that should be made by legislators are made by referendums instead, we get, well, California — a state where ballot initiatives rule what happens to individual bonds and bag taxes and even proposed buildings. Back in 1978, California voters generously decided in a ballot measure to cap their own property taxes in a way — amending the state constitution — that has hobbled ever since California's ability to generate revenue and create reasonable housing policy.\n\nLast year's Supreme Court decision upholding gay marriage also underscored another drawback of referendums: Give people a chance at the ballot box, and they may also trample minority rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo come back to Bell's distinction about the two different kinds of referendums, the Brexit vote arguably looks a little like both. Brexit supporters certainly cast the question as one of fundamental sovereignty and \"independence\" from Europe (as did Donald Trump, with his praise of voters who wanted to \"take back their country\"). But the proposition at hand also raised the kinds of thorny debates we elect government officials to hash out: Do the benefits of the E.U. justify those payments? Will the costs of leaving cripple the British economy? Will \"independence\" bring new forms of instability that voters haven't even been encouraged to foresee?\n\nMartin Kettle, an editor at the Guardian in the U.K., argued last Thursday, before the final vote, that Brexit should itself be a referendum on referendums, \"now the weapon of choice for populist parties of left and right\":\n\nThere may, in certain circumstances, be an argument for referendums in our politics. But the argument has to be better than that we have had some referendums in the past or that a lot of the public would like one. People will always agree they want a say. Yet it is far from obvious that a system of referendums strengthens trust in democracy. Neither Ireland nor Switzerland, where referendums are more common, seem to vindicate that. Germany’s constitution is strongly rooted in the opposite view.

        "content": "Newly elected Polish President Karol Nawrocki is known as an EU skeptic. How can he sway Poland's EU policy, and how is he viewed in Brussels?\n\nRight-wing conservative Karol Nawrocki has won the race for the Polish presidency. During the election campaign, Nawrocki touted his affinity with US President Donald Trump and pledged a \"Poland first\" approach. He opposes Ukraine's accession to NATO and is perceived as an EU skeptic. Polish voters elected Nawrocki with the slimmest of margins on Monday morning, prompting reactions across all of Europe.\n\nMany heads of state and government congratulated the future Polish president. Among those belonging to the right-wing political spectrum were Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The latter enthused about a \"fantastic victory\" and strengthening the work of the Visegrad Group, a political alliance consisting of Poland, Hungary, The Czech Republic and Slovakia. Other heads of state and government, including Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, emphasized common values. French President Emmanuel Macron called on Poland to champion a Europe that's \"strong, independent, competitive\" and \"respects the rule of law.\"\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent congratulations as well. On X, she wrote: \"I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values.\"\n\nNawrocki ideologically close to PiS party\n\nNawrocki is officially non-partisan, but entered the campaign for presidency as a candidate backed by the right-wing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party that ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023. During its term of office, the party reformed the Polish judicial system, sparking an ongoing dispute with Brussels over accusations of dismantling the rule of law. This eventually led to a so-called Article 7 procedure. The European Union's Article 7 allows for the suspension of member state rights if that state seriously and repeatedly violates the EU core values.\n\nDespite new government, Poland remains polarized To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe procedure was closed last year when the country announced it would implement the required changes. As a result, billions of euros were disbursed to Poland, funds that had previously been frozen by the EU due to concerns about the rule of law. Many Polish government proposals were vetoed by sitting President Andrzej Duda, who also has PiS leanings. Observers expect this obstructive stance to continue under the new president. The EU Commission declined to speculate on possible repercussions. In its daily press briefing, it emphasized its confidence in Poland's further implementation of reforms and its support for the country's efforts.\n\nAre new tensions with the EU over the rule of law imminent?\n\nDaniel Freund, a member of the European Parliament, fears that Poland's political deadlock will continue. He calls on the EU commission to correct its \"mistake\" — prematurely releasing frozen EU funds — and to continue putting pressure on Poland.\n\nPiotr Buras, Warsaw bureau head of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told DW that the EU Commission would have to take into consideration what actually happened in Poland. For example, the government under Donald Tusk had seen to it that illegal laws are no longer applied, thus removing the grounds for Article 7 proceedings. Buras believes that a renewed clash with the EU over the rule of law is out of the question with the Tusk government in power.\n\nNawrocki is expected to obstruct the agenda of Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk (pictured above) Image: Frederic GARRIDO-RAMIREZ/European Union\n\nHow will the ballot impact Poland's EU policy?\n\nAccording to Buras, the newly elected president does not have the chance to exert direct influence on Poland's EU policy, because according to the Polish constitution this is solely down to the government, the political scientist said.\n\nAs commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the president of Poland appoints the government, signs international treaties, and has the power to veto laws. This is precisely how Nawrocki could interfere with the government's EU policy, said Buras. As soon as EU policy had to be implemented in national legislation, he could block it, thereby reducing the Tusk government's room for maneuver, he added. Buras expects such blockades in issues like the rule of law, abortion, migration and climate policy. He simultaneously pointed out that the Tusk government was itself far from progressive in the areas of migration and climate policy.\n\nEU Parliament torn between joy and skepticism\n\nWhereas Manfred Weber, chairman of the conservative European People's Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament, hoped that Nawrocki would work \"constructively” with Poland's government for the country's benefit, MEP Rene Repasi believed that the Polish government was caught up in a \"mess.\" For the social democrat, new parliamentary elections are not unlikely, because the right-wing conservative Nawrocki and the \"Tusk government's progressive agenda\" would get in each other's way.\n\nHowever, the right-wing conservative European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which also includes Poland's PiS party, welcomed Nawrocki's election victory. Europe must remain a \"community of free nations,\" not a \"machine\" that ignores \"the will of the people,\" said the group's co-chairman, Nicola Procaccini.\n\nPolitical scientist Buras, however, believes that Nawrocki's election victory was not tantamount to voting against the EU. Neither PiS nor Nawrocki had ever called for Poland's exit from the bloc. At the same time, Buras added that skepticism regarding a loss of sovereignty and interference in the country's internal affairs was widespread in Poland, and Nawrocki had taken advantage of that prevailing mood.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nEdited by: Jess Smee",

        "content": "Poland’s presidential election runoff will be a bitter pill for pro-European Union democrats to swallow.\n\nThe nationalist, Trumpian, historian Karol Nawrocki has narrowly defeated the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, 50.89 to 49.11%.\n\nThe Polish president has few executive powers, though the office holder is able to veto legislation. This means the consequences of a Nawrocki victory will be felt keenly, both in Poland and across Europe.\n\nWith this power, Nawrocki, backed by the conservative Law and Justice party, will no doubt stymie the ability of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Platform-led coalition to enact democratic political reforms.\n\nThis legislative gridlock could well see Law and Justice return to government in the 2027 general elections, which would lock in the anti-democratic changes the party made during their last term in office from 2015–2023. This included eroding Poland’s judicial independence by effectively taking control of judicial appointments and the supreme court.\n\nNawrocki’s win has given pro-Donald Trump, anti-liberal, anti-EU forces across the continent a shot in the arm. It’s bad news for the EU, Ukraine and women.\n\nA rising Poland\n\nFor much of the post-second world war era, Poland has had limited European influence.\n\nThis is no longer the case. Poland’s economy has boomed since it joined the EU in 2004. It spends almost 5% of its gross domestic product on defence, almost double what it spent in 2022 at the time of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPoland now has a bigger army than the United Kingdom, France and Germany. And living standards, adjusted for purchasing power, are about to eclipse Japan’s.\n\nAlong with Brexit, these changes have resulted in the EU’s centre of gravity shifting eastwards towards Poland. As a rising military and economic power of 37 million people, what happens in Poland will help shape Europe’s future.\n\nImpacts on Ukraine\n\nPoland’s new position in Europe is most clearly demonstrated by its central role in the fight to defend Ukraine against Russia.\n\nThis centrality was clearly demonstrated during the recent “Coalition of the Willing” summit in Kyiv, where Tusk joined the leaders of Europe’s major powers – France, Germany and the UK – to bolster support for Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHowever, Poland’s unqualified support for Ukraine will now be at risk because Nawrocki has demonised Ukrainian refugees in his country and opposed Ukrainian integration into European-oriented bodies, such as the EU and NATO.\n\nNawrocki was also backed during his campaign by the Trump administration. Kristi Noem, the US secretary of homeland security, said at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in Poland:\n\nDonald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country.\n\nTrump also hosted Nawrocki in the Oval Office when he was merely a candidate for office. This was a significant deviation from standard US diplomatic protocol to stay out of foreign elections.\n\nNawrocki has not been as pro-Russia as some other global, MAGA-style politicians, but this is largely due to Poland’s geography and its difficult history with Russia. It has been repeatedly invaded across its eastern plains by Russian or Soviet troops. And along with Ukraine, Poland shares borders with the Russian client state of Belarus and Russia itself in Kaliningrad, the heavily militarised enclave on the Baltic Sea.\n\nI experienced the proximity of these borders during fieldwork in Poland in 2023 when I travelled by car from Warsaw to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, via the Suwalki Gap.\n\nThis is the strategically important, 100-kilometre-long border between Poland and Lithuania, which connects the Baltic states to the rest of NATO and the EU to the south. It’s seen as a potential flashpoint if Russia were ever to close the gap and isolate the Baltic states.\n\nPoland’s conservative nationalist politicians are therefore less Russia-friendly than those in Hungary or Slovakia. Nawrocki, for instance, does not support cutting off weapons to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, a Nawrocki presidency will still be more hostile to Ukraine and its interests. During the campaign, Nawrocki said Zelensky “treats Poland badly”, echoing the type of language used by Trump himself.\n\nJarek Praszkiewicz/PAP/EPA\n\nPoland divided\n\nThe high stakes in the election resulted in a record turnout of almost 73%.\n\nThere was a stark choice in the election between Nawrocki and Trzaskowski.\n\nTrzaskowski supported the liberalisation of Poland’s harsh abortion laws – abortion was effectively banned in Poland under the Law and Justice government – and the introduction of civil partnerships for LGBTQ+ couples.\n\nAndrzej Jackowski/PAP/EPA\n\nNawrocki opposed these changes and will likely veto any attempt to implement them.\n\nWhile the polls for the presidential runoff election had consistently shown a tight race, an Ipsos exit poll published during the vote count demonstrated the social divisions now facing the country.\n\nAs in other recent global elections, women and those with higher formal education voted for the progressive candidate (Trzaskowski), while men and those with less formal education voted for the conservative (Nawrocki).\n\nAfter the surprise success of the liberal, pro-EU presidential candidate in the Romanian elections a fortnight ago, pro-EU forces were hoping for a similar result in Poland, as well.\n\nThat, for now, is a pipe dream and liberals across the continent will now need to negotiate a difficult relationship with a right-wing, Trumpian leader in the new beating heart of Europe.",

        "summary": "Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist, defeated Rafał Trzaskowski in Poland's presidential election runoff. Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, will likely hinder Prime Minister Donald Tusk's reforms. This could lead to Law and Justice returning to power in 2027. Nawrocki's victory may impact Poland's support for Ukraine, as he has criticized Ukrainian refugees. During the campaign, Nawrocki received support from the Trump administration. The election saw a high turnout and highlighted social divisions, with women and the highly educated favoring Trzaskowski, and men and those with less education favoring Nawrocki.\n"

        "content": "The polls have spoken. Karol Nawrocki, a historian and former boxer backed by Poland’s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, narrowly triumphed over Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski in Sunday’s presidential election. Nawrocki, whose candidacy was embraced by the Trump administration, will be the head of state opposite the centrist, pro-European head of government, Prime Minister Donald Tusk. With war still raging in next-door Ukraine and US-European relations under strain, what should the world expect from Nawrocki? We turned to our Poland experts for answers.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nDaniel Fried: Nawrocki is well placed to encourage Trump to back Ukraine and European security\n\nAaron Korewa: Poland’s conservative nationalism is pro-American and pro-NATO\n\nMarek Magierowski: Nawrocki’s politics defy hysterical labels\n\nDanuta Hübner: Will the new president overcome Poland’s polarization?\n\nMark Scott: Social media was rampant in this election. But how much impact it had is unclear.\n\nNawrocki is well placed to encourage Trump to back Ukraine and European security\n\nSome initial analysis may depict the Polish presidential election as a fight between democracy and autocracy, or between a pro-Trump and pro-European candidate. This seems exaggerated. The real challenge for Nawrocki will be deciding whether to find common ground with the Tusk government in the face of the threat from Russia and the need to work with the Trump administration on behalf of European and Ukrainian security.\n\nThere are substantive grounds for at least some cooperation across partisan lines in Poland to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression and, to this end, to work with key European allies, such as Britain, France, and Germany, as well as with the United States. Unlike the Hungarian nationalist leader Viktor Orbán, Polish nationalists and outgoing President Andrzej Duda generally support Ukraine and resolutely oppose Russian aggression. In early 2022, for example, PiS party leader Jarosław Kaczyński publicly broke with Orbán over the latter’s lack of support for Ukraine at the time. Poland’s current rapid military buildup began during the previous PiS government and continued under the Tusk coalition. Both political camps support NATO and strong relations with the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration backed Nawrocki during the election campaign. However unwise US official partisanship during an election might have been, this will give Nawrocki advantages as a perceived ideological ally making the case in Washington for continued US military presence in Poland and US support for NATO and Ukraine. Nawrocki may face challenges working with the European Union (EU), which is still a source of significant funding for Polish development and is trying to support military buildup in Europe, an objective Poles across the political spectrum tend to support. He will also have to contain the anti-German rhetoric common to much of the Polish nationalist right. Poland has had legitimate complaints about German policy toward Russia. But it has won those arguments, as many Germans themselves recognize; Nawrocki would do well to take the win and work with Germany to counter the Russian threat both countries face.\n\nMany Poles were supportive of Ukraine in the initial phases of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, providing extensive benefits to Ukrainian refugees and taking hundreds of thousands of them into their homes. While the presence of so many Ukrainian refugees has grown less popular over time, Polish support for Ukraine has remained steady. Still, influential Polish constituencies, such as farmers and some groups concerned with the difficult historical issues between Poles and Ukrainians, have been skeptical about the extent of Polish support for Ukraine. During the campaign, Nawrocki declared that he does not currently support Ukraine’s NATO accession. Now, Nawrocki will have to find a way to balance strategic and political imperatives on support for Ukraine.\n\nAs president, Nawrocki will have to balance his campaign rhetoric and partisan interests with broader national interests. He’s hardly the first winning candidate to have to do so.\n\n—Daniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former US ambassador to Poland.\n\nPoland’s conservative nationalism is pro-American and pro-NATO\n\nThe Poles showed their dissatisfaction with the current government and the political establishment. Nawrocki was an outsider and that paid off. He managed to attract the voters who chose far-right candidates in the first round, while Trzaskowski did not manage to mobilize enough of the voters who supported Tusk’s coalition in October 2023.\n\nFor Europe, this could mean that Poland will become more inwardly focused. At the same time, Tusk has previously signaled that he believes beating populism requires addressing some of the issues that drive it. Expect Poland to take a turn for the right on matters such as migration and the European Green Deal.\n\nNawrocki was the only candidate who visited US President Donald Trump in the White House and received his endorsement. In late May, the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC, also held a rally in the southeastern town of Rzeszów that featured US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Nawrocki’s people made conscious outreach to the US administration. In Poland, the movement that backs Nawrocki is very pro-American and pro-NATO, unlike several other parties in Europe that stand for conservative nationalism. The optimistic scenario is that as president, Nawrocki will establish a connection with Trump that will prevent any plans to withdraw US troops from Poland. At the same time, Tusk’s government will continue forging partnerships with other relevant European states, such as France and the Nordic and Baltic countries.\n\n—Aaron Korewa is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Warsaw Office which is part of the Europe Center.\n\nNawrocki’s politics defy hysterical labels\n\nFirst and foremost, branding Nawrocki as “populist,” “hard-core Euroskeptic,” “far right,” “pro-Putin,” or “Trumpian” is preposterous. Polish politics is too complex to indulge in such simplistic terms.\n\nPoland’s president-elect is probably as “pro-Kremlin” as his entire political camp, which, while in power, provided Ukraine with hundreds of tanks, aircraft, howitzers, and communication gear, while pressuring all European partners to ramp up sanctions against Russia.\n\nNawrocki is also as “Euroskeptic” as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, given the attitude of both politicians toward migration policies and EU climate regulations. And he is as “Trumpian” as his Finnish soon-to-be counterpart Alexander Stubb, who charmingly played a spot of golf with the US president a few weeks ago.\n\nNawrocki is doubtless a staunch conservative who adroitly capitalized on the nature of wide swaths of the Polish electorate, which, contrary to European trends, has remained—politically, socially, and emotionally—attached to the notion of freedom, sovereignty, tradition, and Christian values. The PiS-backed candidate has also largely banked on the rising unpopularity of Tusk’s government, especially among young voters (Nawrocki won the eighteen-to-twenty-nine-year-old cohort).\n\nAnother major factor in Nawrocki’s win was the aristocratic style and aloofness of his rival, Trzaskowski, who was unable to connect with the working class and Poland’s rural constituency. This stood in contrast to Nawrocki, the former boxer and son of a toolmaker and a bookbinder.\n\n—Marek Magierowski is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center and the director of strategy for the Poland program at the Freedom Institute in Warsaw. He previously served as Poland’s ambassador to the United States and to Israel.\n\nWill the new president overcome Poland’s polarization?\n\nPoles know that their vote can change the course of the history of their country. And they have known from day one of this presidential campaign that this election matters deeply for our future. However, as, sadly, the campaign was about preventing the other side from coming to power, it is an open question whether the president we have just elected will understand what is good for Poles in these times of uncertainty.\n\nWill our new president spare no effort to overcome the deep polarization of the Polish people? A polarized society is easy to manipulate and an easy target for Russian disinformation. This is the biggest challenge for the new president—understanding the importance of building bridges between Poles. It is an extremely difficult task, especially in times when many political careers have been built for decades on societal divisions. And I worry that this president-elect comes from a political tradition with little propensity to seek compromise. The presidency is an important part of the Polish system of checks and balances, and the new president will need to support the government in building a democratic Poland where everyone can live.\n\nPoles need a president who will understand that isolation has never done Poland any good, that the European Union is our place, and that it is crucial that Poland takes its share of responsibility for Europe. Will the new president support European efforts to build its defense capabilities and its security-based economic competitiveness? Will he work for peace on our continent?\n\nIn addition, my hope is that the new president will work to keep the United States and Europe together. They need each other.\n\n—Danuta Hübner is a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center. She was Poland’s first-ever European commissioner, responsible first for trade, then with regional policy. She also established and oversaw the institutional structure to deliver Poland’s accession to the EU.\n\nSocial media was rampant in this election. But what impact did it have?\n\nThe narrow victory for Nawrocki in Poland’s presidential election is the latest example of why it’s hard to directly link any country’s electoral outcome with how voters engage with candidates, political operatives, and others across social media. There was a significant amount of hyper-partisan attacks across social media, from both sides, ahead of Sunday’s vote in the Central European country. There was also evidence—including via research from the Atlantic Council—that foreign governments attempted to sway voter outcomes.\n\nBut how successful these efforts were, as well as the ongoing interventions from social media companies to possibly reduce such content’s impact, are almost impossible to quantify. Given the tightly run race, small shifts in voters’ behavior—potentially spurred on by what people may have seen in their online feeds—could have played a role. But, at this stage, that is more a theory than confirmed reality.\n\nThe most recent Polish presidential election joins a growing list of both European and non-European elections in which social media and its impact on how people voted remain a black box. As much as EU policymakers have centered their attention on how the likes of TikTok and YouTube may have amplified anti-EU voices ahead of national elections, there has been a growing offline shift in public opinion across the bloc away from greater EU alignment that has nothing to do with the digital world.\n\nAt best, this weekend’s vote is another example of how, in the middle of 2025, these digital platforms are now part of every country’s election cycle. But social media’s impact on such a closely fought election is mostly unknown.\n\n—Mark Scott is a senior resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab’s (DFRLab) Democracy + Tech Initiative within the Atlantic Council Technology Programs.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: Daniel Fried, Aaron Korewa, Marek Magierowski, Danuta Hübner, and Mark Scott\n\nImage: Law and Justice party supported candidate for the President of Poland Karol Nawrocki during the election evening after the seond round of presidential election in Warsaw, Poland on June 1, 2025.

Domestically, this will have significant implications for Tusk’s judicial reform agenda, much needed to reverse the damage done by eight years of Law and Justice rule and set the country back onto a democratic path.\n\nInternationally, Narwrocki’s victory will also have important implications. He believes that good relations with Brussels, Berlin, and Paris are against Polish interests, and he opposes NATO or European Union membership for Ukraine as long as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. Given that Russia’s initial invasion started in 2014, this does not bode well for Ukraine’s future.\n\nThe global security environment and the continent’s struggles mean that the stakes are high. The EU is wrestling with economic sluggishness and a lack of competitiveness, as well as how to respond adequately to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. The bloc is also divided over how to deal with China during a second Trump term. Various EU countries have unsustainable levels of public debt. This has implications for further borrowing for much-needed joint defense procurement and repayment of NextGenerationEU loans—the European Commission’s economic recovery loans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, climate change is accelerating and has recently devastated communities in Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe increased support for far-right populism adds an additional layer of complexity. Populism’s simplified response to complex challenges may appeal to voters who have faced crisis after crisis with COVID-19 lockdowns, increased energy prices, and high levels of inflation, but it rarely solves the issues. And yet centrist politicians continue to fail to present a viable alternative.\n\nSimply hoping that centrists will do well in an election is kicking the can down the road. It was never a deliberate strategy, of course. But in today’s climate, the absence of a viable plan is dangerous. In Germany, for example, the dangerous moment was not the federal elections held in February. The real danger is what will happen in the next federal elections—due to be held by March 2029—and all the policy decisions made between now and then.\n\nIf centrists are serious about keeping the far right out of power, then they need to get much better at actually addressing voters’ concerns. The key issues will differ by country, of course, but there are shared themes across Europe: the cost of living, the economy, and the security situation tend to be among top voter concerns.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for centrist politicians is to make the case for potentially unpopular policies—a difficult thing to do in an increasingly polarized environment. Yet achieving the energy transition and increasing spending for defense are not optional. The real question, then, is how to gain support for policies that may hurt voters’ personal finances. This has to involve a public debate about the trade-offs.\n\nCurrently, centrist politicians Europe-wide do the exact opposite. Rather than make the case for ambitious policies, they cherry-pick far-right policy positions in an attempt to tempt voters away from the extremes. Lessons from elections in the United Kingdom—and also Poland—show that this creates more momentum for the far right while centrist parties lose their traditional bases to parties that are further left.\n\nThis is how Reform U.K. was galvanized in recent local elections in Britain, and how the far-right Alternative for Germany surged in Germany’s election. It is also an important reminder as the Netherlands likely heads towards a new snap election. (Dutch media is reporting that following the defection of far-right leader Geert Wilders from the ruling coalition, new elections could be held in the fall.) After the conservative-liberal Party for Freedom and Democracy tried to adopt a hard-line anti-immigration rhetoric in the run-up to the last parliamentary election in 2023, it lost voters to far-right Wilders’s Freedom Party.\n\nBeyond specific policy issues, the future of liberal democracy is increasingly being determined at the ballot box. The recent elections in Poland and Romania have presented voters with a stark choice: a vote for rules-based liberalism or a possible descent into MAGA-like quasi-authoritarianism. This has mobilized voters. In both instances, turnout was record high or close to it.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interference—U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem made the trans-Atlantic journey to Poland a few days before the second round to stump for Nawrocki—may have had an impact too. While most Polish diaspora voters voted for Trzaskowski, Poles in the United States voted overwhelmingly for Nawrocki.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, voters are demanding change from their governments, which are seen by many as corrupt and stuck. In Hungary, former Fidesz insider Peter Magyar’s support keeps increasing in polls ahead of the parliamentary election that is scheduled for spring 2026. Magyar is running on a platform to address corruption at a time when inflation remains high and voters feel worse off economically.\n\nIn Serbia, protests have been ongoing for months: What started as a student-led movement demanding answers regarding a collapsed train station canopy roof that killed 16 people has turned into a nationwide anti-corruption and rule of law movement against populist nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic’s government; the head of his prime minister has already rolled.\n\nIn Slovakia, thousands have protested a so-called foreign agents law, which opponents say is copied straight from the Kremlin and makes it harder for nongovernmental organizations and civil society to operate in the country.\n\nWhat this suggests is that ultimately, across the spectrum, voters want accountability. There will always be an election somewhere, but currently, too many pressing policy issues hinge on an election going “the right way.” Centrists need to get active and come up with a better plan.",

        "content": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe.\n\nNawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country’s domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.\n\nHere are some key takeaways:\n\nConservative populism on the rise\n\nNawrocki’s victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions.\n\nThe 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland’s sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.\n\nHis win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right — even the far right in recent times.\n\nFar-right candidates did very well in Poland’s first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.\n\nAs his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.\n\n“Poland remains a deeply divided country,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, the president of the Polish Institute of Public Affairs.\n\n“Although the electoral turnout was highest ever in history of presidential elections, Mr. Nawrocki’s margin of victory is very small, which means that half of Poland will be cheering his presidency, whereas half of Poland, the other half, remains deeply worried or even disturbed,” he added.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk’s troubles\n\nNawrocki’s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.\n\nBut Tusk’s coalition — a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives — has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.\n\nNawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk’s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.\n\nTies with the Trump administration\n\nNawrocki’s election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.\n\nPoland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.\n\nTrump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.\n\nA shifting focus on Ukraine\n\nWhile Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid — particularly support for refugees.\n\nHis rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland’s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki’s approach could shift Poland’s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.\n\nTies with the EU\n\nThe election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk’s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.\n\n“This is very bad news for the European Union as well as Poland’s key European partners, both Germany and France as well as Ukraine,” said Kucharczyk, the analyst.\n\n“Mr. Nawrocki is well known for his Eurosceptic stand. He’s opposed to deepening European integration and European cooperation. He is also opposed to Ukraine’s NATO membership,” he added.\n\nNawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland’s national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.\n\nWhile the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki’s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels’ efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.\n\nMarket jitters\n\nThough an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.\n\nBillions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk’s government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.\n\n___\n\nAP’s video journalist Rafal Niedzielski in Warsaw, Poland, contributed to this report.",

Chris Smith (R-NJ), Keith Self (R-TX), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Warren Davidson (R-OH), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), and Andy Harris (R-MD).\n\nRead the full letter here and below.\n\nDear President von der Leyen:\n\nWe write to express profound alarm over reported developments in Poland that may undermine the integrity of its democratic processes, particularly as the country approaches the second round of its presidential election on June 1, 2025. Reports of foreign-funded political advertisements favoring Rafał Trzaskowski, the Civic Coalition (KO) candidate backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, that may have occurred in contravention of Polish law, combined with the Tusk government’s reported monthslong refusal to comply with court orders to release public funding to the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, suggest a deliberate effort to tilt the electoral playing field. These actions, occurring under the European Commission’s watch, expose a troubling double-standard in the EU’s approach to Poland’s rule of law, which demands your urgent attention.\n\nOn May 15, an investigation by a leading Polish publication reported that a Polish NGO, which received funding from organizations funded by U.S. Democratic Party megadonor George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, facilitated the production of social media advertisements promoting Trzaskowski and discrediting his rivals, PiS-backed Karol Nawrocki and Confederation-backed Sławomir Mentzen. Several sources also reported that Estratos Digital GmbH—a Vienna-based firm majority-owned by Higher Ground Labs, a U.S. fund operated by major Democratic Party operatives who helped run the U.S. presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris—was behind the approximately 420,000 PLN ($105,000 USD) in allegedly “illegal political ads” posted by the Polish NGO on Facebook since April 10, 2025 in support of Trzaskowski. Estratos is the same organization that reportedly played a key role backing the anti-Viktor Orban opposition in Hungary’s 2022 elections, allegedly “concealing campaign financing sources, raising additional red flags about their operations in Poland.”\n\nEqually disturbing are reports of the Tusk government’s monthslong refusal to release tens of millions of dollars in public campaign funding that PiS is legally entitled to receive, defying a ruling by the Supervisory Chamber of Poland’s Supreme Court, a payment demand from Poland’s National Electoral Commission, and an opinion by Poland’s Ombudsman (Human Rights Commissioner) Marcin Wiące to release the money. Further, by withholding these funds, the Tusk administration appears to be attempting to cripple PiS’s ability to compete fairly in the presidential election and violating the rule of law.\n\nThe European Union, as a guarantor of democratic standards and human rights under the Treaty on European Union, has a responsibility to ensure that member states uphold the rule of law. Yet, despite the European Commission’s vocal criticism and decision to withhold over $150 billion from Poland for alleged rule of law violations under the previous PiS government, it has remained conspicuously silent despite clear evidence of rule of law violations under Tusk’s administration. In fact, in February 2024—after the Tusk government ousted and installed a new National Prosecutor without President Duda’s approval in reported violation of Polish law—the European Commission, under your direction, released $7.1 billion (€6.3 billion) of the funds it had been withholding from the PiS government despite the fact that the Tusk government had not yet implemented any of the “milestones” the EU had demanded the previous PiS government complete for their release. This selective enforcement—condemning and sanctioning PiS while ignoring Tusk’s actions—suggests a double standard that could undermine the EU’s credibility as a guardian of democratic principles.\n\nThese developments also raise critical questions about the integrity of Poland’s democratic institutions and the EU’s role in ensuring fair elections. To address these concerns, we respectfully request that your staff arrange a briefing to answer the following questions:\n\n1. What entities provided the $105,000 (420,000 PLN) used for the Facebook advertisements promoting Rafał Trzaskowski, and did any of these funds originate from foreign sources in violation of Polish electoral law?\n\n2. What role, if any, did Estratos Digital GmbH and its U.S.-based owner, Higher Ground Labs, play in coordinating or financing these advertisements, and to what extent were U.S. Democratic Party operatives directly involved?\n\n3. How does the Commission justify its failure to address the Tusk government’s refusal to release millions of dollars in court-ordered funding to PiS, given its prior sanctions against the prior PiS government for rule-of-law violations?\n\n4. Why has the Commission remained silent on Finance Minister Andrzej Domański’s defiance of Poland’s Supreme Court, National Electoral Commission, and Ombudsman rulings, given its previous vocal criticism and aggressive actions against the PiS government?\n\n5. What oversight mechanisms, if any, has the Commission implemented to prevent foreign-funded NGOs, such as those linked to George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, from influencing Poland’s 2025 presidential election?\n\n###",

Many of its legislative efforts had been blocked by PiS-aligned incumbent President Andrzej Duda and that is likely to continue under Nawrocki.\n\nIn his speech immediately after the polls closed, when the result was still in doubt, Nawrocki said: “We will save Poland, we will not allow the power of Donald Tusk to be complete.”\n\n“Nawrocki’s presidency means a high-level conflict between the president and Tusk,” said Joanna Sawicka, a political analyst with Polityka Insight, a Warsaw-based think tank. “But it’s clear that it will be difficult for the government to implement key reforms because the president can veto most of them.”\n\nThe Polish presidency is a largely ceremonial function, and the government is in charge of foreign policy, but the president can veto legislation or send it off for judicial review. The Tusk-led coalition doesn’t have the votes in parliament to override that, so a President Nawrocki will make it very difficult for the prime minister to govern.\n\n“The opposition camp, now led by Nawrocki, may also strive for early parliamentary elections, although it is not clear if this strategy could succeed. If not, a change in power is likely in 2027 anyway,” Sawicka added.",

        "content": "Aleks Szczerbiak analyses the results of the recent Polish presidential election which saw right-wing candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly beat centrist Rafał Trzaskowski with 50.89 percent and 49.11 percent of the vote respectively. He argues Karol Nawrocki’s election will have significant implications on the ability of the ruling coalition to govern effectively until its term ends in 2027.\n\nAlthough the Polish President is not involved in day-to-day governance and has no formal foreign policy competencies, Mr Nawrocki’s victory will de-stabilise the government, severely complicate its institutional reform and legislative agenda, and limit its room for manoeuvre on the international stage, especially when it comes to relations with the EU.\n\nHistorian Karol Nawrocki – supported by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) grouping, won a narrow victory in the country’s presidential election. He defeated Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski – candidate of the liberal-centrist Civic Platform (PO), currently the main governing party led by prime minister Donald Tusk – by a margin of 50.9% to 49.1%.\n\nThe narrowness of Mr Nawrocki’s victory on a record 71.6% turnout, reflects deep divisions within Polish society. Mr Nawrocki’s voters, generally based in smaller towns and rural areas, tend to be less well-off, less well-educated, more culturally conservative, Eurosceptic, and often deeply suspicious of the elites and institutions that have emerged in Poland since the collapse of communism.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s victory will have huge implications for the ability of the ruling coalition to govern effectively during the remainder of its term, which runs until autumn 2027. Since it took office in December 2023, Mr Tusk’s government has had to ‘cohabit’ with Law and Justice-aligned President Andrzej Duda and lacks the three-fifths parliamentary majority required to over-turn a presidential legislative veto.\n\nThe President can also delay legislation by referring it to the constitutional tribunal, a powerful body which rules on the constitutionality of Polish laws. All its members were appointed by previous Law and Justice-dominated parliaments. The Tusk government does not recognise the tribunal’s legitimacy and is refusing to implement its rulings, but if the presidential referral is made under the so-called ‘preventative control’ mode, legislation only comes into effect after the tribunal’s ruling, providing it with a de facto veto.\n\nThis will continue to function as a major obstacle to the Tusk government’s efforts to unravel its predecessor’s legacy, particularly attempts to roll back judicial reforms. Around 2,500 judges appointed by Mr Duda, including the majority of the country’s supreme court, were nominated by the national judicial council (KRS), which was overhauled by Law and Justice in 2018. Most of its members are now chosen by elected bodies such as parliament rather than the legal profession, as was the case previously.\n\nThe Tusk government does not recognise these appointments, referring to them disparagingly as ‘neo-judges’, but, like Mr Duda, Mr Nawrocki will block any reforms that he feels undermine their legitimacy. The European Commission had stipulated that the introduction of legislative changes to unravel Law and Justice’s judicial reforms were a strict condition for unblocking Poland’s access to EU coronavirus recovery funds. Brussels unfroze these funds when Mr Tusk returned to office on the basis of an action plan rather than actual changes to the legal system. Mr Nawrocki’s election means that such legislation is very unlikely to be approved leaving Brussels vulnerable to charges of continuing to apply double standards if still allows the Tusk government access to these funds.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s huge electoral mandate, in a contest framed as a referendum on the Tusk government, will also create political momentum that Law and Justice hopes will carry it through to victory in the next parliamentary poll. However, an early election is unlikely. Dissolving parliament is virtually impossible without the consent of the governing parties , and all of them want to maintain their access to state appointments and patronage for as long as possible. The Tusk administration will be increasingly weak and divided but is likely to hold together.\n\nPolish foreign policy is determined by the government, so Mr Nawrocki’s impact here is likely to be limited and largely symbolic. But symbolism matters in international politics, and the President does have some foreign affairs-related competencies. Most importantly, he is commander-in-chief of the armed forces so can influence security policy debates. Ambassadorial appointments also must be approved by the President. Poland does not currently have a full Ambassador to Washington because Mr Duda refused to accept the government’s nominee.\n\nMr Nawrocki supports continued Polish EU membership but is an anti-federalist and argues that Poland’s interests often clash with the major European powers, especially Germany, with whom Mr Tusk has been trying to build closer ties. Due to public hostility, the Tusk government has had to put support for deeper European integration in areas such as migration and climate policy on the back-burner. Mr Nawrocki’s victory could further limit its room for manoeuvre on these issues if, for example, he proposes legislation rejecting the EU’s Green Deal.\n\nMr Nawrocki will also prioritise maintaining close ties with the USA, which he argues is Poland’s only credible security guarantor, and oppose the development of a European defence capability outside of NATO structures. The Trump administration openly supported Mr Nawrocki, including a headline-grabbing Oval Office meeting with US President himself.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s critics argue that, by expressing scepticism about Ukrainian NATO accession, he is legitimising the Russian war narrative. In fact, Mr Nawrocki supports the broad consensus within Poland on the need to continue providing diplomatic and military aid to Ukraine; Moscow has even issued an arrest warrant against him. However, Mr Nawrocki has criticised Ukraine’s lack of co-operation with exhumations of the remains of Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War, and pledged to protect Polish farmers from what he argues is unfair competition from Ukrainian agricultural goods. He clearly favours a more transactional approach to relations with Ukraine and feels that Poland needs to be more assertive in promoting its interests when these clash with its Eastern neighbours.\n\nThe Polish President is a largely ceremonial figure not involved in the day-to-day governance of the country in either domestic or foreign policy. But his ability to block legislation, together with the political authority that comes from a huge electoral mandate and political dynamics that this can unleash, mean that Mr Nawrocki’s election will be extremely significant in terms of shaping how Poland is governed in the coming years.\n\nBy Professor Aleks Szczerbiak, Professor of Politics & Head of Department, University of Sussex",

        "summary": "Karol Nawrocki, supported by Law and Justice (PiS), narrowly defeated Rafał Trzaskowski of Civic Platform (PO) in the Polish presidential election with 50.9% of the vote. Nawrocki's victory will destabilize the government and complicate institutional reform. As President, Nawrocki can veto legislation and refer it to the Constitutional Tribunal, obstructing the Tusk government's efforts to reverse judicial reforms. Nawrocki will block reforms undermining the legitimacy of \"neo-judges.\" He supports Polish EU membership but opposes deeper integration and favors close ties with the USA. Nawrocki will prioritize Poland's interests regarding Ukraine, including agricultural competition and historical exhumations. His election, though to a largely ceremonial role, significantly shapes Poland's governance.\n"

It was a really close race, but I think it'll all be good, things will get better,\" 58-year-old security guard Waldemar told AFP in Warsaw.\n\nAccountant and history buff Anna Maria Ziolkiewicz said \"the brightest Poland\" won.\n\nThe 61-year-old religious conservative from Lodz, central Poland told AFP she voted for Nawrocki \"because he is a patriot\".\n\n'They'll block everything'\n\nBut Trzaskowski voter Zdzislaw Brojek said he expected \"chaos\" under the new president, who he claimed would do the PiS party's bidding.\n\n\"They will block laws, they'll block everything,\" the 65-year-old gardener told AFP in Warsaw.\n\nTrzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.\n\nNawrocki's campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over a murky apartment purchase and his football hooligan past.\n\nNawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.\n\n\"It was a genocide against the Polish people,\" he said.\n\nPoland is a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine.\n\nIt is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)",

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nProtesters had amassed in Washington, D.C., to reject the results of the Nov. 3 election, cheering as President Trump himself addressed the crowd and urged them to protest what he falsely claims was a rigged election before marching to the Capitol and pushing past security barriers there.\n\nThe protests are timed to coincide with Congress' certification of the Electoral College votes and aim to pressure Republican lawmakers into supporting Trump's effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nTrump supporters, many wearing red MAGA hats but no face masks, gathered at The Ellipse where the president addressed them midday Wednesday. The crowd faced the White House and a stage was flanked by two big \"Save America March\" signs swayed to the beat of the Village People song \"Macho Man\" and Michael Jackson's \"Billy Jean.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nAfter the speech, they pushed past barriers onto the Capitol grounds, while yelling, \"Whose Capitol? Our Capitol,\" NPR's Hannah Allam reports. Police and other security put up more barriers and security layers as protesters breached the initial security layer. Protesters climbed the scaffolding, looking for any way in to get to the Capitol, Allam said, and armed police rushed in tackling them.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs thousands of Trump supporters climbed up the side of the Capitol to get inside, bursts of what appeared to be gas cannisters are being fired though it was not clear who was firing them.\n\nEarlier, the mood was celebratory though the rhetoric was angry with speaker after speaker telling the crowd, \"We can't back down. This is just the beginning.\" The president's son Donald Trump Jr. greeted the crowd with: \"Hello, Patriots!\"\n\nOutside the U.S. Capitol, several dozen Trump supporters waved flags and prayed for \"angel armies\" to intervene, calling on lawmakers inside to \"reject\" the election.\n\nA huge contingent of Proud Boys marched in, some chanting \"storm the Capitol\" and \"1776!\" and massed for the Capitol building.\n\nFor many in the crowd, it was inconceivable that Congress would certify the November vote, as it's expected to. Echoing the president's words, they pledged to fight, some calling for a rebellion and others vowing to refocus energy on the 2024 race. And they made it clear that Republicans who didn't back Trump would pay a price.\n\n\"We're not moving on,\" said Lawrence Ligas, a 55-year-old from Chicago who said he used to be a Democrat before Trump \"earned\" his vote.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hannah Allam/NPR Hannah Allam/NPR\n\n\"We are not Republicans. We are the MAGA party. We are patriots,\" he said.\n\nNearby, 28-year-old Lisa Hayes was attracting a crowd with her outfit: a white tulle ballgown covered with mail-in ballots marked \"STOLEN.\"\n\n\"I am the 2020 election,\" Hayes said.\n\nAs she was explaining that the importance of election integrity brought her to Washington, a bystander interrupted and gestured toward her thin outfit in 43-degree weather.\n\n\"You're not freezing?\" he asked Hayes.\n\n\"My blood is boiling, so I'm fine!\" she replied.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMayor Bowser had said Wednesday that her city was ready to keep protests peaceful and protesters safe, even though Trump tweeted that Wednesday's protests would be \"wild.\"\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that the president himself has incited violence,\" said the mayor.\n\nPolice stablished a bigger \"traffic box\" a perimeter where vehicle traffic is restricted, she said, and, \"we have our entire police force activated\" along with National Guard and with help from other nearby jurisdictions, the mayor said.\n\n\"All of that is very expensive,\" said Bowser, \"we incur overtime costs when we do that.\"\n\nThe nation's capital is a cradle of protests, and Bowser says it's the city's responsibility to provide support for the movements of the president and the many demonstrations taking place in the Trump administration. The federal government hasn't paid its public safety bill in two years, but Bowser says she's confident that D.C. will be reimbursed.\n\n\"The federal government owes us about $100 million,\" she said. \"We will continue to work with the Congress to make sure we're made whole for our emergency fund.\"\n\nBowser also praised D.C. police for the arrest earlier this week of Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, leader of the far-right group Proud Boys. Tarrio has been barred from the District and is facing misdemeanor destruction of property charges and two felony counts of possession of high capacity firearm magazines.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by NPR, the magazines are AR-15/M4 compatible with a capacity of 30 rounds each, and every magazine is labeled with the Proud Boys insignia.\n\n\"I sell on my site,\" Tarrio told the officers who found the magazines in his bookbag. \"I had a customer that bought those two mags, and they got returned 'cause it was a wrong address. And I contacted him, and he's like, 'I'm going to be in D.C.,' so I'm like, 'OK, I'll take 'em to you.' \"\n\nProud Boys members typically dress in black and yellow, but are planning to wear all black, to mimic Antifa, a loose affiliation of far-left activists. The two groups have violently clashed in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police confirmed that permits for Wednesday's rally at The Ellipse had all been approved, including an amendment from 5,000 people to 30,000 people.\n\nEvery city police officer is on duty, and the city has also mobilized 300 members of its National Guard.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nProtesters had amassed in Washington, D.C., to reject the results of the Nov. 3 election, cheering as President Trump himself addressed the crowd and urged them to protest what he falsely claims was a rigged election before marching to the Capitol and pushing past security barriers there.\n\nThe protests are timed to coincide with Congress' certification of the Electoral College votes and aim to pressure Republican lawmakers into supporting Trump's effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nTrump supporters, many wearing red MAGA hats but no face masks, gathered at The Ellipse where the president addressed them midday Wednesday. The crowd faced the White House and a stage was flanked by two big \"Save America March\" signs swayed to the beat of the Village People song \"Macho Man\" and Michael Jackson's \"Billy Jean.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nAfter the speech, they pushed past barriers onto the Capitol grounds, while yelling, \"Whose Capitol? Our Capitol,\" NPR's Hannah Allam reports. Police and other security put up more barriers and security layers as protesters breached the initial security layer. Protesters climbed the scaffolding, looking for any way in to get to the Capitol, Allam said, and armed police rushed in tackling them.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs thousands of Trump supporters climbed up the side of the Capitol to get inside, bursts of what appeared to be gas cannisters are being fired though it was not clear who was firing them.\n\nEarlier, the mood was celebratory though the rhetoric was angry with speaker after speaker telling the crowd, \"We can't back down. This is just the beginning.\" The president's son Donald Trump Jr. greeted the crowd with: \"Hello, Patriots!\"\n\nOutside the U.S. Capitol, several dozen Trump supporters waved flags and prayed for \"angel armies\" to intervene, calling on lawmakers inside to \"reject\" the election.\n\nA huge contingent of Proud Boys marched in, some chanting \"storm the Capitol\" and \"1776!\" and massed for the Capitol building.\n\nFor many in the crowd, it was inconceivable that Congress would certify the November vote, as it's expected to. Echoing the president's words, they pledged to fight, some calling for a rebellion and others vowing to refocus energy on the 2024 race. And they made it clear that Republicans who didn't back Trump would pay a price.\n\n\"We're not moving on,\" said Lawrence Ligas, a 55-year-old from Chicago who said he used to be a Democrat before Trump \"earned\" his vote.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hannah Allam/NPR Hannah Allam/NPR\n\n\"We are not Republicans. We are the MAGA party. We are patriots,\" he said.\n\nNearby, 28-year-old Lisa Hayes was attracting a crowd with her outfit: a white tulle ballgown covered with mail-in ballots marked \"STOLEN.\"\n\n\"I am the 2020 election,\" Hayes said.\n\nAs she was explaining that the importance of election integrity brought her to Washington, a bystander interrupted and gestured toward her thin outfit in 43-degree weather.\n\n\"You're not freezing?\" he asked Hayes.\n\n\"My blood is boiling, so I'm fine!\" she replied.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMayor Bowser had said Wednesday that her city was ready to keep protests peaceful and protesters safe, even though Trump tweeted that Wednesday's protests would be \"wild.\"\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that the president himself has incited violence,\" said the mayor.\n\nPolice stablished a bigger \"traffic box\" a perimeter where vehicle traffic is restricted, she said, and, \"we have our entire police force activated\" along with National Guard and with help from other nearby jurisdictions, the mayor said.\n\n\"All of that is very expensive,\" said Bowser, \"we incur overtime costs when we do that.\"\n\nThe nation's capital is a cradle of protests, and Bowser says it's the city's responsibility to provide support for the movements of the president and the many demonstrations taking place in the Trump administration. The federal government hasn't paid its public safety bill in two years, but Bowser says she's confident that D.C. will be reimbursed.\n\n\"The federal government owes us about $100 million,\" she said. \"We will continue to work with the Congress to make sure we're made whole for our emergency fund.\"\n\nBowser also praised D.C. police for the arrest earlier this week of Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, leader of the far-right group Proud Boys. Tarrio has been barred from the District and is facing misdemeanor destruction of property charges and two felony counts of possession of high capacity firearm magazines.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by NPR, the magazines are AR-15/M4 compatible with a capacity of 30 rounds each, and every magazine is labeled with the Proud Boys insignia.\n\n\"I sell on my site,\" Tarrio told the officers who found the magazines in his bookbag. \"I had a customer that bought those two mags, and they got returned 'cause it was a wrong address. And I contacted him, and he's like, 'I'm going to be in D.C.,' so I'm like, 'OK, I'll take 'em to you.' \"\n\nProud Boys members typically dress in black and yellow, but are planning to wear all black, to mimic Antifa, a loose affiliation of far-left activists. The two groups have violently clashed in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police confirmed that permits for Wednesday's rally at The Ellipse had all been approved, including an amendment from 5,000 people to 30,000 people.\n\nEvery city police officer is on duty, and the city has also mobilized 300 members of its National Guard. The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department issued a traffic advisory that includes parking restrictions and street closures around downtown, a larger perimeter than in previous pro-Trump protests.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP\n\n\"My level of anxiety is high,\" D.C.

        "content": "As President Trump told a sprawling crowd outside the White House that they should never accept defeat, hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in what amounted to an attempted coup that they hoped would overturn the election he lost. In the chaos, law enforcement officials said, one woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nThe violent scene — much of it incited by the president’s incendiary language — was like no other in modern American history, bringing to a sudden halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nWith poles bearing blue Trump flags, a mob that would eventually grow into the thousands bashed through Capitol doors and windows, forcing their way past police officers unprepared for the onslaught. Lawmakers were evacuated shortly before an armed standoff at the House chamber’s entrance. The woman who was shot was rushed to an ambulance, police said, and later died. Canisters of tear gas were fired across the Rotunda’s white marble floor, and on the steps outside the building, rioters flew Confederate flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“USA! USA!” chanted the would-be saboteurs of a 244-year-old democracy.\n\nThe Senate stopped its proceedings, and the House doors were closed. In a notification, U.S. Capitol Police said no one would be allowed to come or go from the building as they struggled to regain control. “Stay away from exterior windows, doors. If outside, seek cover,” police warned.\n\nAll 1,100 members of the D.C. National Guard were activated, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) imposed a citywide curfew. From 6 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday, Bowser said, no one other than essential personnel would be allowed outdoors in the city.\n\nThe mob had arrived hours earlier, charging past the metal barricades on the property’s outer edge. Hundreds, then thousands followed them. Some scaled the Capitol’s walls to reach entrances; others climbed over one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day’s end, four people would be dead: one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies that officials have yet to explain.\n\nOn the building’s east side, police initially pushed the pro-Trump demonstrators back but soon gave up and fell back to the foot of the main steps. Within a half-hour, fights broke out again, and police retreated to the top of the stairs as screaming Trump supporters surged closer. After police perimeters were breached, the elated crowd began to sing the national anthem.\n\nFor an hour, they banged on the doors, chanting, “Let us in! Let us in!” Police inside fired pepper balls and smoke bombs into the crowd but failed to turn them away. After each volley, the rioters, who were mostly White men, would cluster around the doors again, yelling, arguing, pledging revolution.\n\nSometime after 2:10 p.m., a man used a clear plastic riot shield to break through the windows on a first floor to the south side of the building, then hopped in with a few others. Once inside, police suspect, rioters opened doors to let in more of their compatriots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Capitol Police officer yelled from a higher stairway at the intruders, ordering them to stop, but when they didn’t, the officer fired at a man coming at him, two law enforcement officials said. Amid shouts and people rushing to get away from the sound of gunfire, rioters saw a woman in their group collapse. Police believe she was unarmed, a law enforcement official said, but the officer who shot her did not know that. Capitol Police had already been warned by D.C. police that many in the crowds were secretly carrying weapons.\n\n“They shot a girl!” someone yelled as a group of Trump supporters ran out of the southeast entrance.\n\nA team of paramedics with a gurney soon arrived and a Capitol Police officer stepped aside to let them pass. “White female, shot in the shoulder,” the officer said as they hurried past. They emerged minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the gurney was a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt. Dressed in jeans, the 35-year-old gazed vacantly to one side, her torso and face covered in blood. Babbitt, a California native and an Air Force veteran, was a staunch supporter of the president.\n\nAs the gurney was loaded into the back of the ambulance, pro-Trump rioters swarmed around it, screaming, “Murderers!”\n\nCapitol Police officers with long guns pushed them back, and the ambulance drove off.\n\nInside, where the lawmakers had donned gas masks kept under their chairs, Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) could only think of his family as he and other lawmakers hid from the mob. Reeling from the loss of his 25-year-old son last week, Raskin had taken one of his daughters and his son-in-law to the Capitol to watch the debates unfold over certification of Biden’s election, he said, “because we wanted to be together.” Raskin was helping lead Democrats’ arguments against Republican objectors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I thought I could show them the peaceful transfer of power in the United States of America,” Raskin told C-SPAN earlier. “What was really going through my mind was their safety because they were not with me in the chamber, and I just wanted us all to get back together.”\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said members were told that chemical irritants had been released in Statuary Hall and, for a moment, braced for the possibility that they would be exposed to tear gas. Capitol Police barricaded the doors with tables and bookshelves.\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA case officer, said that it was a crisis she would only expect to see unfold in fragile, faraway places.\n\n“This is what we see in failing countries,” she said. “This is what leads to a death of democracy.”\n\nThe shooting and the breach triggered an instant call for help across Washington to other law enforcement agencies. At the U.S. Secret Service, headquarters sent out an emergency alert to all gun-carrying Secret Service personnel to report to headquarters in preparation to help secure the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other rioters streamed into the building, where they smashed windows and vandalized offices amid furious clashes with officers desperate to maintain control.\n\n“MURDER THE MEDIA,” read a message written on one door.\n\n“WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN,” read another left in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also refused to back down, later directing her colleagues to return and finish validating Biden’s victory.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, shared a photo on Twitter of a long-haired man in a Trump hat carrying a rostrum adorned with the gold-colored seal of the speaker.\n\n“Arrest this man,” she demanded.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., more law enforcement in riot gear arrived at the Capitol.\n\n“Traitors,” Trump supporters shouted. “What’s your oath?”\n\nBiden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault” on American democracy, “unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos,” he said. “It borders on sedition, and it must end now.”\n\nFor hours, Trump made little effort to quell the violence he had helped instigate, finally sharing a video at 4:17 p.m. in which he told people to “go home” — while continuing to promote the falsehood that he had won the election.\n\n“We love you,” he told them. “You’re very special.”\n\nThe Capitol has been the target of violence before. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from a House gallery, injuring five lawmakers on the floor below. In 1971, a bomb planted by a radical left-wing group exploded, though no one was harmed. In 1998, a gunman opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. But not since the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814 has a mob overrun the ultimate symbol of American freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fallout on Wednesday was immediate, stunning the world, the country and, perhaps most of all, political Washington. Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) in denouncing Trump for provoking the mob, while Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all temporarily banned him from their platforms. Several conservative lawmakers who had planned to object to Biden’s certification announced that they had changed their minds.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m., just an hour or so after hundreds of law enforcement officers had at last finished clearing the mob and removing Trump flags left inside the building, heavily armed FBI agents and police officers in riot gear escorted lawmakers back to work.\n\nAs discussion inside the battered building resumed, the sense of fear that had gripped the nation’s capital for much of the day had yet to subside.\n\nFederal agents were investigating a pickup truck found with weapons, ammunition and potential bombmaking material parked outside the Republican National Committee, according to two people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The truck, parked across the street from the party offices and near the entrance to a Metro station, contained rifles and shotguns and a mass of ammunition, these people said. Federal agents were still trying to determine whether that vehicle and its contents are connected to suspected pipe bombs found earlier in the day.\n\nBy late evening, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said officers had arrested at least 52 people, including four for carrying pistols without a license, one for possession of a prohibited weapon and 47 for curfew violations and unlawful entry. Along with the pipe bombs, he said, police discovered a cooler packed with molotov cocktails on the Capitol grounds. In total, 14 D.C. officers were injured Wednesday. One was hospitalized after being pulled into a crowd and assaulted, and another received “significant facial injuries” after being hit with a projectile.\n\nJust past sunset, a man was stabbed at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, near Freedom Plaza, but it was unclear whether the attack was related to the assault at the Capitol, a mile east.\n\nThose who had made it inside the building took on a celebrity status when they came back out. A woman who said she had footage on her phone of Capitol Police pointing guns at rioters was circled by dozens who wanted to see it. People traded what information they had about the woman who was shot inside. Some called her a “martyr.”\n\nAfter she was taken away, the mood soured, though many remained joyous. “We’re making history,” one woman said as she strolled down Independence Avenue with friends.\n\nBeneath streaming flags, including some that read “F--- Biden” and that depicted Trump as the movie character Rambo, people loudly exhorted Jesus and chanted “USA!”\n\nMany called friends and family and took videos.\n\n“We weren’t violent before, but we are now,” a middle-aged White man said, talking into his cellphone. “There’s no going back.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nDespite weeks of planning between federal and local police agencies ahead of Wednesday’s Trump rally – including tracking social media – officials said that going into Wednesday they had no intelligence indicating there was a threat the US Capitol could be overrun.\n\nIt would turn out to be a catastrophic failure after an angry mob overwhelmed police and stormed into the Capitol building, ransacking lawmakers’ offices, injuring dozens of officers and stealing electronics and documents that could possibly include sensitive national security information. Five people died during the riots, including a woman shot by US Capitol Police and a police officer.\n\nDuring conference calls that included federal agencies and the city’s police ahead of the rally, federal law enforcement officials say the US Capitol Police assured counterparts they had the situation under control—they knew how to deal with large demonstrations at the Capitol, in large part because the complex was already being prepared for Inauguration Day, one of the most secure events in the city, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFederal and local officials said Thursday they did not have intelligence suggesting any violent mob was preparing to attack the Capitol, even as demonstrators were publicly saying on social media they were not planning a typical protest.\n\nDespite weeks of preparations, “obviously, what happened no one anticipated,” Michael Sherwin, acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters in a telephone press conference Thursday. “Things could have been done better.”\n\nOf course, there were reports of violence when Trump’s backers had come to town last month, and the FBI was monitoring everything from social media to the hotels where some of the rioters were staying. One sign of the preparations came in the days before the rally, when, acting on the FBI’s intelligence information, Washington’s Metropolitan Police arrested Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, after he left the airport en route to his hotel.\n\nHe was charged for his role in destroying a Black Lives Matter banner at a previous Proud Boys march in Washington, and prosecutors later added charges for carrying two extended ammunition magazines that are illegal in the city. As part of his release, a local judge told him to leave town and to stay away from Wednesday’s rally.\n\nPolice were caught flat-footed the next day. DC Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Thursday there was no intelligence that suggested there would be a breach of the US Capitol on January 6. Three DHS sources, who usually receive such reports, were unaware of a threat assessment being shared from the DHS intelligence office ahead of Wednesday’s siege.\n\nSeveral federal executive branch agencies had teams on standby ready to assist Capitol Police. And they weren’t aware the Capitol Police weren’t in any position to be able to prevent the insurrection at the Capitol that led to some of the most secure areas of the building to be overrun by rioters.\n\nThe call for help from the Capitol Police came as protesters, apparently riled up from speeches during a rally near the White House, began converging at barricades outside the Capitol. It was too late.\n\nSerious questions about being caught off guard\n\nThe ransacking of the Capitol has sparked serious questions across Washington about how the US Capitol was caught so off guard – putting in danger lawmakers as well as Vice President Mike Pence – and why law enforcement treated President Donald Trump’s supporters differently than the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred last year. The episode has quickly led to recriminations on Capitol Hill – with Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund planning to resign next week – and vows to investigate the incident from Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant at Arms, Michael Stenger, submitted his resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nPart of the planning for the Trump rally took into account criticism that federal and local police, and the US National Guard received for handling of summer protests, federal and local officials say.\n\nThis included a heavy-handed response to protesters near Lafayette Park, who were cleared to make way for a Trump photo op walk to St. John’s Church across from the White House. The visible police and National Guard presence for the Trump rally was notably less aggressive than during summer protests.\n\nA Homeland Security law enforcement source said the “most glaring and obvious speck in our eye is when you contrast it to similar demonstrations that did not always go well and the response,” referring to the heavy-handed response DHS had in Portland and Washington, DC this past summer.\n\nCoordinated by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, federal executive branch agencies had more than 500 officers and agents close by and ready to help, a Justice Department spokesman said.\n\n“We had what I believe were sufficient federal resources for this,” Sherwin said, adding, “I cannot speak for the Capitol Police.”\n\nSund issued a statement Thursday saying that Capitol Police “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.”\n\n“But make no mistake – these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior,” Sund said, adding that the rioters “actively” attacked officers and were “determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage.”\n\nBut police chiefs across the country who plan for major protests, sometimes with other agencies, make contingency plans for how to respond when something goes wrong – for when a First Amendment protest turns into violence, which Wednesday’s rioters said all along it would be.\n\nOne of the complications of the capital is that the Capitol Police reports to Congress and is separate from the Executive Branch agencies, including the FBI and Secret Service, which don’t have jurisdiction on the Capitol grounds unless requested by the Capitol Police.\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Terrance Gainer told CNN that Washington, DC, police have responsibility for the entire city, while Capitol police cover the area that includes the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings.\n\n“What’s kind of been worked out is, everyone tends to their business until we need each other,” Gainer said. “There’s some concurrent jurisdictions, some separate.”\n\nIn practice, the different agencies do their own work until they’re needed. There was a time when Metro Police couldn’t give field sobriety tests so Capitol Police would respond to DUI traffic stops, Gainer said.\n\nCall for help came too late\n\nSherwin said the first indication of trouble was when crowds began breaching entrances on the east front of the Capitol building.\n\nFederal officials had been asked for help – first with bomb threats in multiple locations, and then to the Capitol itself – but they said by the time they were asked to respond to the chaos at the Capitol, it was too late for them to intervene and stop the building from being breached.\n\n“They have jurisdiction. And the minute they asked for support, we sent it,” Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said on Fox News. “And by the way, they asked for support before violence began. So that was not a pure reaction. There was some planning to it. But it was just too close to when everything began to heat up. And they were outnumbered and overwhelmed. I mean, that’s why you see pictures like that. It’s pure, it’s just numbers.”\n\nMultiple federal law enforcement agencies deployed emergency response teams near the Capitol on Wednesday that were eventually deployed to respond to the unfolding rioters that had breached the Capitol building.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department, DC’s local police force, said there was a call for help from Capitol Police at 1 p.m. Both the FBI and the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau had teams near the Capitol, and after they received a call for help, more than 300 agents and officers were deployed to the Capitol, sources told CNN.\n\nBut less than 90 minutes later, the Capitol was under siege as rioters entered into some of the most secure parts of the building, including the Senate chamber and Pelosi’s office.\n\nThe Homeland Security law enforcement official said both ICE and CBP had quick response teams available if needed for any protests or breach of headquarters locations. Those teams were on standby, the official said, but there was no request for DHS assets to go to the Capitol beyond a limited number of Secret Service and Federal Protection Service officers.\n\nThe FBI response included SWAT teams and other special agents who were deployed to assist US Capitol Police to clear the Capitol grounds, as well as a Hostage Rescue Team. The FBI also has evidence response teams on site collecting evidence and bomb technicians to respond to pipe bombs at buildings that house the Republican and Democratic National Committees.\n\nA team of The ATF’s explosive specialists responded to bomb threats in Washington, DC. A short time later, they received the call for help from Capitol Police and ATF’s special response team and agents from Baltimore and Washington deployed to the Capitol to assist clearing the rioters.\n\nCongressional leaders quickly got on the phone with acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy in the early moments of the riots, while lawmakers were being evacuated from the House and Senate chambers, Schumer said Thursday. The call was tense, a source said, with lawmakers demanding answers about why there wasn’t better protection.\n\n“The question is why weren’t they there in advance, and then why didn’t they get there ASAP. All of that needs to looking into,” Schumer told reporters.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan Thursday said that he was on the phone with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who pleaded with him to send the Maryland National Guard to help. But Hogan said the Maryland Guard was told multiple times “we don’t have authorization” and waited an hour and a half before he finally received a call from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy to the Capitol.\n\nHogan said that McCarthy asked him, “‘Can you come as soon as possible?’ Yeah, we’ve been waiting. We’re ready.”\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that it was Pence, not Trump, who helped to facilitate members of the DC National Guard deploying to the Capitol, and Trump initially resisted deploying the National Guard.\n\nClearing the Capitol\n\nAfter lawmakers, aides and reporters had been evacuated to safety, it was the FBI and ATF teams that ultimately cleared the Capitol building, and not Capitol police, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe two agencies each went from one end of the Capitol, room-to-room, meeting in the middle to clear the building and allow Congress to return to the House and Senate chambers to finish certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win, sources said.\n\nAround 7 p.m., as the Capitol complex was being cleared, federal law enforcement agencies held another call with Pence and House and Senate leaders. Capitol Police were not included in the call, according to one source, and the tone was quite different than the earlier call as the situation was still unfolding.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was up late into the night in Qatar monitoring events as they unfolded on Capitol Hill Wednesday, according to a DHS official familiar with his trip. In light of the siege on the Capitol, Wolf arranged to return to the US as quickly as possible, the official said, following visits to Cyprus, Bahrain and Qatar this week.\n\nICE Homeland Security Investigations personnel, who were deployed to support Federal Protective Service last year to protect the agency’s buildings amid protests, were not sent out to the Capitol Wednesday, and stayed at ICE headquarters as they did during the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, though they were on standby to assist, according to two officials. Federal Protective Service, meanwhile, requested assistance from US Customs and Border Protection to protect federal facilities and property.\n\n“There are many questions lingering about the attack on the US Capitol and it will take time to discover the answers,” said FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor in an internal message to the workforce Thursday, which was obtained by CNN. FEMA staff, Gaynor said, worked overnight to “support efforts to ensure continuity of government operations.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect a Capitol Hill police officer has died.",

Coordinated by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen , federal executive branch agencies had more than 500 officers and agents close by and ready to help , a Justice Department spokesman said . “ We had what I believe were sufficient federal resources for this , ” Sherwin said , adding , “ I can not speak for the Capitol Police. ” Sund issued a statement Thursday saying that Capitol Police “ had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities. ” “ But make no mistake – these mass riots were not First Amendment activities ; they were criminal riotous behavior , ” Sund said , adding that the rioters “ actively ” attacked officers and were “ determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage. ” But police chiefs across the country who plan for major protests , sometimes with other agencies , make contingency plans for how to respond when something goes wrong – for when a First Amendment protest turns into violence , which Wednesday ’ s rioters said all along it would be . One of the complications of the capital is that the Capitol Police reports to Congress and is separate from the Executive Branch agencies , including the FBI and Secret Service , which don ’ t have jurisdiction on the Capitol grounds unless requested by the Capitol Police . Former Capitol Police Chief Terrance Gainer told CNN that Washington , DC , police have responsibility for the entire city , while Capitol police cover the area that includes the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings . “ What ’ s kind of been worked out is , everyone tends to their business until we need each other , ” Gainer said . “ There ’ s some concurrent jurisdictions , some separate. ” In practice , the different agencies do their own work until they ’ re needed . There was a time when Metro Police couldn ’ t give field sobriety tests so Capitol Police would respond to DUI traffic stops , Gainer said . Call for help came too late Sherwin said the first indication of trouble was when crowds began breaching entrances on the east front of the Capitol building . Federal officials had been asked for help – first with bomb threats in multiple locations , and then to the Capitol itself – but they said by the time they were asked to respond to the chaos at the Capitol , it was too late for them to intervene and stop the building from being breached . “ They have jurisdiction . And the minute they asked for support , we sent it , ” Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said on Fox News . “ And by the way , they asked for support before violence began . So that was not a pure reaction . There was some planning to it . But it was just too close to when everything began to heat up . And they were outnumbered and overwhelmed . I mean , that ’ s why you see pictures like that . It ’ s pure , it ’ s just numbers. ” Multiple federal law enforcement agencies deployed emergency response teams near the Capitol on Wednesday that were eventually deployed to respond to the unfolding rioters that had breached the Capitol building . The Metropolitan Police Department , DC ’ s local police force , said there was a call for help from Capitol Police at 1 p.m . Both the FBI and the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau had teams near the Capitol , and after they received a call for help , more than 300 agents and officers were deployed to the Capitol , sources told CNN . But less than 90 minutes later , the Capitol was under siege as rioters entered into some of the most secure parts of the building , including the Senate chamber and Pelosi ’ s office . The Homeland Security law enforcement official said both ICE and CBP had quick response teams available if needed for any protests or breach of headquarters locations . Those teams were on standby , the official said , but there was no request for DHS assets to go to the Capitol beyond a limited number of Secret Service and Federal Protection Service officers . The FBI response included SWAT teams and other special agents who were deployed to assist US Capitol Police to clear the Capitol grounds , as well as a Hostage Rescue Team . The FBI also has evidence response teams on site collecting evidence and bomb technicians to respond to pipe bombs at buildings that house the Republican and Democratic National Committees . A team of The ATF ’ s explosive specialists responded to bomb threats in Washington , DC . A short time later , they received the call for help from Capitol Police and ATF ’ s special response team and agents from Baltimore and Washington deployed to the Capitol to assist clearing the rioters . Congressional leaders quickly got on the phone with acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen , acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy in the early moments of the riots , while lawmakers were being evacuated from the House and Senate chambers , Schumer said Thursday . The call was tense , a source said , with lawmakers demanding answers about why there wasn ’ t better protection . “ The question is why weren ’ t they there in advance , and then why didn ’ t they get there ASAP . All of that needs to looking into , ” Schumer told reporters . Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan Thursday said that he was on the phone with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , who pleaded with him to send the Maryland National Guard to help . But Hogan said the Maryland Guard was told multiple times “ we don ’ t have authorization ” and waited an hour and a half before he finally received a call from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy to the Capitol . Hogan said that McCarthy asked him , “ ‘ Can you come as soon as possible ? ’ Yeah , we ’ ve been waiting . We ’ re ready. ” CNN reported on Wednesday that it was Pence , not Trump , who helped to facilitate members of the DC National Guard deploying to the Capitol , and Trump initially resisted deploying the National Guard . Clearing the Capitol After lawmakers , aides and reporters had been evacuated to safety , it was the FBI and ATF teams that"

        "content": "Right-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦",

        "ori_content": "Right-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦"

Some have tried to shift the blame for their actions to former President Donald Trump and his lies about a stolen election. Others have claimed they were trying to protect themselves from overzealous police officers.\n\nIn Webster's case, prosecutors repeatedly showed frame-by-frame footage of him assaulting a Metropolitan Police Department officer with a metal flagpole, tackling him to the ground and trying to rip off his gas mask.\n\nWebster testified he was trying to protect himself from a “rogue cop” who punched him in the face. A juror who spoke to reporters after the May 2022 verdict said the videos refuted Webster’s self-defense claims.\n\n“I guess we were all surprised that he would even make that defense argument,” the juror said. “There was no dissension among us at all. We unanimously agreed that there was no self-defense argument here at all.”\n\nBefore U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced him to 10 years in prison, Webster apologized to the officer. He said he wished he had never come to Washington, where he says he “became swept up in politics and former President Trump’s rhetoric.”\n\n“I wish the events of that horrible day had never happened. People would still be alive, people would not have gotten hurt, and families would not have been thrown apart. Perhaps our country would not be as divided as it is today,” Webster said.",

        "content": "US Department Of Defense Officially Designates ‘League Of Legends’, ‘Path Of Exile 2’ Parent Company Tencent As One Of Many “Chinese Military Companies” Operating Within The Country\n\nCommando Jarvan IV (Kyle Herbert) reports for duty in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nIn the latest escalation of geo-political tensions between the two world superpowers, a routine investigative procedure conducted by the United States’ Department of Defense has resulted in the China-based entertainment conglomerate Tencent being officially identified as one of the many “Chinese military companies” currently operating on Uncle Sam’s home turf.\n\nFire prove completely ineffective against the Count of Ogham’s forces in Path of Exile II (2025), Grinding Gear Games\n\nRELATED: Geoff Keighly’s The Game Awards Honored Amir Satvat As A Folk Hero For Laid Off Devs – In Reality He’s A Tencent Exec Who Runs A Glorified Unemployment List\n\nFor those unfamiliar with or in need of a refresher regarding the overtly-bureaucratic mechanics of the American government, to put it extremely succinctly, rather than having free access to Uncle Sam’s bank account, the country’s military, under the general jurisdiction of its Department of Defense, is instead given a yearly and variable operating budget, as determined and approved by Congress.\n\nPrior to 1961, the entire process was handled solely by the respective Appropriations committees of the governing body’s two chambers, the House and the Senate (and prior to 1867, the original Finance Committee). However, in 1961, Congress began making use of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), thus respectively dividing up the duties of budget usage determination and funding between the Senate and House’s individual Armed Services and Appropriations committees.\n\nGangplank (Dennis Collins Johnson) defends the colonies against the British in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nTo this end, when it came to the NDAA for 2021, all four bodies approved the inclusion of a new measure, as derived from an executive order from then-President Donald Trump barring American investment in China’s war fighting industry, requiring the Secretary of Defense to spend the next ten years “identify[ing] each entity the Secretary determines, based on the most recent information available, is operating directly or indirectly in the United States or any of its territories and possessions, that is a Chinese military company” and provide an annual report on their findings.\n\n“The term ‘Chinese military company’ does not include natural persons,” clarified Congress within the Act’s text. “and means an entity that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or beneficially owned by, or in an official or unofficial capacity acting as an agent of or on behalf of, the People’s Liberation Army or any other organization subordinate to the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party; or identified as a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base; and engaged in providing commercial services, manufacturing, producing, or exporting.”\n\nA Sorceress unleashes her lightning in Path of Exile II (2025), Grinding Gear Games\n\nRELATED: Ubisoft Continues To Implode As Founding Guillemot Brothers Reportedly Teaming With Chinese Tencent To Take ‘Assassin’s Creed Shadow’ Developer Private\n\nAnd it was in the Secretary’s latest round of determinations, as made publicly available on January 6th, that Tencent Holdings Limited – Perhaps most notable among this site’s readership for their video game-related holdings, which currently include full ownership over such entities as League of Legends developer Riot Games and Path of Exile duology team Grinding Gear Games, as well as a number of partial investments in such studios as Dark Souls series heralds FromSoftware and the ever-flailing Ubisoft – was confirmed to have received the ‘military company’ label.\n\nUnfortunately for those curious, at current, the US government has not disclosed just which aspects of the Chinese corporate giant’s operations have drawn their suspicions, with the Secretary’s official communique on the matter only containing a list of the infringing companies.\n\nGangplank (Dennis Collins Johnson) drops in for a sneak attack in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nFor their part, Tencent has rejected the Department of Defense’s findings, telling the press in a written statement, “[our] inclusion on this list is clearly a mistake.”\n\n“We are not a military company or supplier,” they asserted. “Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding.”\n\nLiliweiss (Yukari Tamura) tracks the whereabouts of the Red Hood (Yoko Hikasa) in Goddess of Victory: Nikke (2022), Shift Up/Tencent\n\nUnder the recently passed NDAA for 2024, starting in June 2026, the Department of Defense will no longer be allowed to directly purchase “goods services, or technology to provide a service that connects to the facilities of a third party, including backhaul, roaming, or interconnection arrangements” from Chinese military companies, and will be banned from doing so indirectly the following year.\n\nWhether Tencent will manage to convince the US government to remove them from said list before this ban takes effect remains to be seen.\n\nNEXT: New Update To Riot Games’ Terms Of Service Gives ‘League Of Legends’ Dev The Right To Respond To Players’ “Off-Platform Conduct” With “Penalties In-Game”\n\nSpencer Baculi By As of December 2023, Spencer is the Editor-in-Chief of Bounding Into Comics.

But before you can make a good build for it, you'll need to craft it first. This short guide will go over how to get the Riot-848, covering everything from drop rates to crafting requirements for each part.\n\n## How To Get The Riot-848\n\nThe Riot-848 is a drop from the **Solstice Square Defense mission in Hollvania**. You'll unlock access to all Warframe 1999 content upon completing \" \" questline. Once complete, use the 1999 terminal aboard your Orbiter to view all Hollvania missions. Solstice Square is the top left node on the map.\n\nThis mission functions identically to Lua Defense, requiring you to **defend Flare against waves of enemies. **After the first three waves, Flare's stage will collapse into the sewer system below. Flare will stay at this location for the rest of the mission. This area is far more claustrophobic than the surface and has more spawn locations for the enemies, leading to much faster waves if you have a strong loadout.\n\nAs for the weapon itself, **Riot-848 drops from each rotation in Solstice Square. **All parts can drop in each rotation (A, B, and C), although higher rotations have a higher drop chance. Remember that reward payouts go in the following order, with payouts being every three waves: AABC, AABC, AABC...\n\nIf you can't get any of the Riot-848's components to drop, **you can also purchase the blueprints from Flare directly in the Hollvania hub. **Components will require Beating Heartstrings to purchase this way, a currency you'll earn for successful wave clears. You'll need** 300 Beating Heartstrings **to purchase all Riot-848 components.\n\n### Riot-848 Drop Rates\n\nDrop rates were derived from Warframe PC Drops, a website hosted by Digital Extremes that shows exact drop rates for all items in Warframe. Despite the website name, drop rates are the same between PC and console.",

        "content": "Happy Friday! We are getting close to the 90-day deadline that President Donald Trump set back in January for the secretaries of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to recommend whether the president should invoke the Insurrection Act to address what he described as an “invasion” of gangs, human traffickers, and criminals at the southern border.\n\nMore than 10,000 service members are currently deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prevents federal troops from enforcing civilian laws within the United States. As such, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agents accompany troops on patrols to conduct any law enforcement activities.\n\nBut the Insurrection Act suspends Posse Comitatus when the country faces a rebellion, political violence, or other major incidents, said Risa Brooks, a political science professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin.\n\nGet Task & Purpose in Your Inbox Sign up for Task & Purpose Today to get the latest in military news each morning, and The Pentagon Rundown for a weekly breakdown of the biggest stories every Friday. Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n“If the Insurrection Act were invoked by a president, and the secretary of defense ordered it, the military would likely be able to apprehend migrants or clear the streets of protesters,” Brooks said.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush last invoked the law in 1992 in response to riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney King.\n\nIt’s worth noting that invoking the Insurrection Act is not the same as declaring martial law.\n\n“The difference from martial law is that the elected civilians remain in charge and civil law remains — the military are enforcing existing civil law, not making the laws,” said Kori Schake, head of the defense policy team at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. “They are legally empowered to behave as police, including to use lethal force to suppress insurrections, riots, and enforce the law.”\n\nAs always, there’s plenty more news. Here’s your weekly rundown.\n\nThat’s all a lot to process for one week. Stay tuned for more developments.\n\nJeff Schogol",

        "content": "Brigade N'Hamedu riot at an Eritrean festival in The Hague, 2024.\n\nThe Washington Post’s latest anti-Eritrea propaganda demonizes Eritrean immigrants defending themselves in the West.\n\nThe US has a lot of problematic friends in the Red Sea region, most notably Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Along with his habit of chopping off heads and having them hung in the public square, MBS is credited with having journalist Adnan Khashoggi dismembered with a bone saw at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has performed a record 213 public executions this year.\n\nMore Gulf monarchies distinguished by hair-raising human rights violations and even modern-day slavery include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Like Saudi Arabia, they all prop up the petrodollar, host US military bases, and purchase vast lethal supplies of US weapons, and all but Qatar backstab Palestine. None could disembowel enough kittens to fall afoul of US sanctions.\n\nAnd then of course there’s Israel.\n\nJust south and west of this ghastly pantheon is Eritrea, a Red Sea nation that defies the dictates of Western powers, pursues egalitarian social development, eschews IMF and World Bank debt, demands a fair price for its natural resources, and refuses to collaborate with AFRICOM, the US Africa Command.\n\nNot surprisingly, Eritrea is heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for alleged human rights abuse. Exclusion from the SWIFT system for conducting international financial transactions puts it in the exclusive company of the West’s other favorite bogeymen, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\n\nWestern politicians, pundits, and press relentlessly castigate Eritrea—never mind their headchopping friends across the Red Sea—with the most recent salvo coming from the Washington Post. The Biden Administration trained its soft power sights on the country, and this comes in its waning days.\n\nThe Post’s Nairobi correspondent, Katharine Houreld, authored the hit piece titled “How a tyrannical African country freely raises money in the U.S.” She notes that the US sanctioned Eritrea’s ruling party in 2021, alleges that the ruling party and the government are one and the same, and worries that it might be illegal to fundraise for a US sanctioned country in the US, citing anonymous experts who “said the practices deserve closer scrutiny, including the role played by nonprofit groups.” A US government Fact sheet says it’s legal to send humanitarian assistance to Cuba, which has been under US sanctions since 1962, so this threat of “close scrutiny” appears intended to intimidate Eritrean Americans.\n\nAt least 14 nonprofits raise money to be spent in Israel, including two, Israel Friends and Friends of the Israel Defense Force (FIDF), who raise funds directly for the IDF. That’s just for the record, given that Israel is of course not sanctioned by the US.\n\nFundraising for a lawsuit to protect Eritrean Americans\n\nA careful read of Katharine Houreld’s piece makes it clear that very little of the fundraising it decries is about funds to be spent by the Eritrean government or even to be spent in Eritrea. It's about a Zoom call which she claims was intended to raise money for a lawsuit against people who’ve attacked Eritrean Americans at cultural festivals and events here in the US, specifically for their attack on the Eritrean American Festival in the Seattle-Tacoma area in August 2023. Houreld also mentions past fundraising for COVID relief and cancer care in Eritrea.\n\nI attended the 2022 Eritrean Festival in Dallas, where someone gave a presentation on delivering improved cancer care. People in the audience then stood up, one after another, glowing and eager to announce contributions on behalf of their local Eritrean American communities.\n\nThere was no fundraising of any sort at the 2023 festival in Seattle or the 2024 festival in Washington DC.\n\nHoureld also writes that these are festivals \"where women in diaphanous white dresses twirl in traditional dances, pro-government musicians croon before rapt audiences, and attendees feast on steaming bowls of Eritrean cuisine.\" Oh . . . My . . .God. Sounds like fun. As one Eritrean American responded on X, “We don’t need the government or the Washington Post’s permission to have a good time!”\n\nHoureld is writing about the Seattle festival from Nairobi, but I was there. The hooligans arrived at 6 a.m., waking us up to loud sounds of destruction and gunshots. They tore down exhibition tents, vandalized property, even set Eritrean dresses on fire, and paraded around waving American flags and blue-and-green Brigade N’Hamedu flags. They later sent several festival goers to the nearest emergency room.\n\nMany Brigade N’Hamedu militants seem to have emigrated from the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, which lost its 2020-2022 war with the Ethiopian government aided by Eritrea. Others seem to be Eritreans from near the border between Tigray and Eritrea who identify as Tigrayans.\n\nWestern countries give special preference to migrants from Eritrea, as they do Cubans and Venezuelans, in an attempt to depopulate those countries of their gifted and educated youth. The Daily Mail recently published an exposé about Tigrayans on TikTok, bragging that they had managed to “con their way into Britain” by claiming to be Eritrean and “sharing huge swathes of training material to convince case officers they are from Eritrea.”\n\nAt least three individuals named in the EAGS lawsuit are of Tigrayan origin. Temesgen Kahsay, a named defendant who identifies as Tigrayan, openly admits on social media that “a large portion of the Eritrean opposition are Tigrayans. Others are Tigrayan by their mother or father’s ancestry lines.” This statement is supported by ongoing investigations. For example, in Germany, where the first attack occurred in a parliamentary hearing, German politician Jörg-Uwe Hahn notes that “the perpetrators of violence are violent groups led by the probably extremist organization 'Brigade N'Hamedu' from Tigray (Northern Ethiopia).\" The narrative that Eritreans are “clashing” continues to erode.\n\nThe militants are on a mission to undermine and violently attack Eritrean expat communities throughout the West, from Stockholm to Seattle and even Tel Aviv. In 2023, they attacked festivals and events in those cities and in Giessen and Stuttgart, Germany, London, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Denver, Dallas, St. Louis, and Atlanta. In 2024, they attacked in The Hague, Breslau, London, Indianapolis, Charlotte, and again Tel Aviv (church service) and Atlanta.\n\nThe group openly operates with a “Plan A” to warn municipal authorities and venue owners that there may be violence and prevent them from granting permits for Eritrean-themed events. Their “Plan B” is to attack the events if that fails.\n\nAt the beginning of her essay, Katharine Houreld writes, “Earlier this year, for example, about 100 Eritreans living across the United States joined a Zoom call co-hosted by officials from the Eritrean Embassy aimed at raising money to support their country’s struggle against its opponents,” which of course sounds repressive. No government should struggle against its opponents, should they? Especially not against opponents favored by the US government, opponents who might even be attempting a color revolution.\n\n“The Eritrean chargé d’affaires,” Houreld continues, “pressed those on the call to hold their own fundraising events and to urge fellow members of the diaspora to contribute as much as they could.”\n\nIt then takes Houreld another eleven paragraphs to acknowledge that the fundraising that she believes took place on this Zoom call was neither for money to be spent by the Eritrean government, nor even to be spent within the borders of Eritrea. She believes that it was instead to be spent by the Eritrean Association in Greater Seattle (EAGS) in support of their legal complaint against the hooligans who attacked their festival.\n\n“The Eritrean officials on the call said the money, in this instance,” she finally writes, “would finance a lawsuit in the United States against demonstrators who had been protesting against Eritrean government abuses.”\n\nDemonstrators protesting? Brigade N’Hamedu proudly documented their own EAGS festival riot on social media livestreams and then posted it to a YouTube channel. A number of the defendants in the lawsuit can be easily identified in the video.\n\nUnlike the constant stream of Western media propaganda demonizing Eritreans, Brigade N’Hamedu’s violent attacks are creating evidence that they are violating the laws of host countries across the West.\n\nAs earlier reported here, investigations of the many 2023 attacks are underway, and in Calgary, 28 people have been indicted on 63 criminal charges.\n\nCalgary Chief Constable Mark Neufeld told local news, “We’re not policing ideologies. We don’t get on one side or the other of this. This is around behavior for us, and so the behavior that we see in the videos and the reporting of this is the very same behavior that we’ve seen in other cities, and it’s not OK. It’s not OK in our city.”\n\nNeufeld also said that these were not clashes between two groups but violent attacks by one group upon another.\n\nThe list of Brigade N’Hamedu attackers who have been indicted and/or convicted keeps growing. Hundreds have been arrested and charged around the world. Global kingpin John Black was sentenced to four years for the Hague attack.\n\nNotable charges in the USA, include Kidane Woldemariam, who faces felony assault charges with a deadly weapon; he allegedly shot Eritreans at a peaceful event in November 2023. Haile Tseada, a defendant in the EAGS lawsuit, was arrested and charged with assaulting Charlotte police in the February 2024 riot.\n\nThere have been no more attacks since the EAGS filed their federal complaint.\n\nAnother lawsuit based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which makes it illegal to participate in organized crime, is in the works.\n\nAnn Garrison is a Black Agenda Report Contributing Editor based in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2014, she received the Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza Democracy and Peace Prize for her reporting on conflict in the African Great Lakes region. She can be reached at [email protected].

The Washington Post published an article alleging illegal fundraising by Eritreans in the U.S. for Eritrea's ruling party.

Brigade N'Hamedu has attacked Eritrean expat communities throughout the West in multiple cities, including attacks in 2023 and 2024. The group uses a strategy to prevent Eritrean events or attack them if prevention fails. The Eritrean Association in Greater Seattle (EAGS) filed a federal complaint against the attackers, leading to ongoing investigations, indictments, and convictions, including a four-year sentence for John Black in The Hague. There have been no more attacks since the EAGS filed their federal complaint. A RICO lawsuit is in development.\n"

A police van was also set on fire, as violence took place just a few streets away from where the vigil was held.\n\nopen image in gallery One officer is suspected to have suffered a broken nose during the disturbances ( Pat Hurst/PA Wire )\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday night, Merseyside Police said they believed supporters of the English Defence League (EDL) were behind the disturbances.\n\nThe far-right group has a strong presence on social media, where leaders will mobilise supporters. It was once led by Tommy Robinson, with many members chanting his name during the events.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the anti-Islam hate organisation:\n\nWho are the English Defence League (EDL)?\n\nFounded in 2009, the EDL is a far-right, Islamophobic pressure group. Its members will often mobilise for street demonstrations against immigration and multi-culturalism, and sometimes mount counter-action to protests with progressive aims.\n\nThe group rose to prominence between 2009 and 2012, during much of which it was informally led by Robinson. Real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, Robinson was imprisoned several times during these years for violent or disruptive behaviour.\n\nMany of the early EDL members were recruited from Luton football club supporters, Robinson’s home town team. The group has links to football hooliganism.\n\nThe EDL’s rise coincided with the decline of the British National Party as an electoral force. The far-right political party gained over half a million votes at the 2010 general election, a record-high. It has now faded into electoral obscurity.\n\nopen image in gallery Tommy Robinson marches with supporters in central London ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\nRobinson stood down as leader of the EDL in 2013, citing fears over the “dangers of far-right extremism.” The same year, he would publicly apologise to Muslim communities and offer to give evidence to the police to aid their investigation of EDL members.\n\nHe has since been convicted for contempt of court and stalking, and was most recently arrested on 28 July under anti-terror laws. The 41-year-old had screened a film to supporters in central London repeating false claims he had made about a Syrian refugee, over which he lost a libel case in 2021.\n\nHis arrest came after he organised a counter-protest to a Stand Up To Racism march that was happening in the capital on July 27. Engaging with his supporters on Facebook, he said the event would be the “biggest patriotic rally the UK has ever seen.” Nine of his supporters were arrested after clashes with the police.\n\nopen image in gallery Members of the right-wing EDL take part in a protest in Tower Hamlets, east London on September 3, 2011. ( Carl Court/AFP via Getty Images )\n\nLast year, right-wing protesters mobilised in the city on Armistice Day to mount a counter-protest to the weekly pro-Palestine marches which have been ongoing during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The group clashed with police at the Cenotaph, and 145 people were arrested, most of whom belonged to the counter-protesters.\n\nSpeaking after the events then-prime minister Rish Sunak said: “I condemn the violent, wholly unacceptable scenes we have seen today from the EDL and associated groups and Hamas sympathisers attending the National March for Palestine.”\n\nDespite a decline over the past decade, EDL members are known to mobilise after certain events to express anti-Islam views, such as the attack in Southport. Members are thought to have also spread to other far-right groups such as National Action and Patriotic Alternative, which also organise protests.",

        "content": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nShinzo Abe was a political blueblood groomed for power. Japan's longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history.\n\nAbe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past.\n\nAt the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons.\n\n“He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ... He also wanted Japan to not have to keep apologizing for World War II.”\n\nAbe, who died after being shot during a campaign speech, was 67.\n\nPolice arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the attack, which shocked many in Japan, one of the world’s safest nations with some of the strictest gun control laws. Near the suspect was a double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun.\n\nAbe believed that Japan's postwar track record of economic success, peace and global cooperation was something \"other countries should pay more attention to, and that Japanese should be proud of,” Leheny said.\n\nAbe was a darling of conservatives but reviled by many liberals in Japan. And no policy was more divisive than his cherished, ultimately unsuccessful dream to revise Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. His ultra-nationalism also angered the Koreas and China, both wartime victims of Japan.\n\nAssassination caught on camera\n\nAbe was in Nara campaigning ahead of Sunday’s election for Japan's upper house and was giving a speech when he was shot.\n\nIn eyewitness video from the scene, which was widely shared on social media, two shots can be clearly heard. Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired footage showing Abe collapsing on the street, with several security guards running toward him. He was bleeding and holding his chest.\n\nTwitter, Facebook parent Meta and other social media companies scrambled Friday to police videos on their platforms of the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that break rules on harmful content.\n\nMultiple videos of the attack by a gunman who fired a homemade, double-barreled weapon twice at Abe circulated on social media. Some only show the moments before and after the attack while others showed both shots.\n\nTwitter said its enforcement teams were working to “address harmful content” relating to the attack by “proactively removing” material that violates its rules, which include restrictions on sensitive media including graphic violence.\n\nTwitter urged users to flag up any potentially sensitive material of the attack so it can take action. Videos of the attack could still be found easily on Twitter many hours after the attack.\n\nMeta said it was deleting videos depicting the moment of the attack and had disabled the suspect’s Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nHow has Europe reacted?",

        "ori_content": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nShinzo Abe was a political blueblood groomed for power. Japan's longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history.\n\nAbe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past.\n\nAt the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons.\n\n“He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ... He also wanted Japan to not have to keep apologizing for World War II.”\n\nAbe, who died after being shot during a campaign speech, was 67.\n\nPolice arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the attack, which shocked many in Japan, one of the world’s safest nations with some of the strictest gun control laws. Near the suspect was a double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun.\n\nAbe believed that Japan's postwar track record of economic success, peace and global cooperation was something \"other countries should pay more attention to, and that Japanese should be proud of,” Leheny said.\n\nAbe was a darling of conservatives but reviled by many liberals in Japan. And no policy was more divisive than his cherished, ultimately unsuccessful dream to revise Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. His ultra-nationalism also angered the Koreas and China, both wartime victims of Japan.\n\nAssassination caught on camera\n\nAbe was in Nara campaigning ahead of Sunday’s election for Japan's upper house and was giving a speech when he was shot.\n\nIn eyewitness video from the scene, which was widely shared on social media, two shots can be clearly heard. Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired footage showing Abe collapsing on the street, with several security guards running toward him. He was bleeding and holding his chest.\n\nTwitter, Facebook parent Meta and other social media companies scrambled Friday to police videos on their platforms of the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that break rules on harmful content.\n\nMultiple videos of the attack by a gunman who fired a homemade, double-barreled weapon twice at Abe circulated on social media. Some only show the moments before and after the attack while others showed both shots.\n\nTwitter said its enforcement teams were working to “address harmful content” relating to the attack by “proactively removing” material that violates its rules, which include restrictions on sensitive media including graphic violence.\n\nTwitter urged users to flag up any potentially sensitive material of the attack so it can take action. Videos of the attack could still be found easily on Twitter many hours after the attack.\n\nMeta said it was deleting videos depicting the moment of the attack and had disabled the suspect’s Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nHow has Europe reacted?"

        "content": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nTo many in Asia-Pacific, Shinzo Abe was prescient in recognizing the challenge a rising China posed to the American-led system of political and military alliances.\n\nAnd the former Japanese Prime Minister – killed by an assassin’s bullet on July 8 – arguably did more than any of his Western contemporaries to meet that challenge.\n\nAbe, who served two separate terms and was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, will be remembered by many as the leader who finally led the country out of the shadows of World War II.\n\nHe foresaw that the rapid growth of China’s People’s Liberation Army – fueled by one of the world’s fastest growing economies – would upset the regional balance of power, and argued Japan would, as a result of this shift, have to rethink its post-war, US-imposed pacifist constitution.\n\nIn 2014, Abe’s government reinterpreted that constitution to enable the Japanese military to theoretically fight overseas. And he gave it the tools to do so, buying stealth fighters and building Japan’s first aircraft carriers since World War II to accommodate them.\n\nBut perhaps his biggest contribution to the defense of his country – and to many, the security of the wider Asia region – lies not in military equipment, but in language; in his coining of the simple phrase: “a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nParadigm shift\n\nWith those few words, Abe transformed the way many foreign policy leaders talk – and think – about Asia.\n\nToday, much to the annoyance of China’s leaders, that phrase is everywhere. It is used like a mantra by the US military and is the vocabulary of choice for any aspiring Western diplomat.\n\nSo it can be hard to remember that, before Abe, few people in these circles talked of the “Indo-Pacific” at all.\n\nBefore 2007, the preference in Washington was to conceptualize Asia as that great stretch of the globe spanning from Australia to China to the United States – and to refer to it as the “Asia-Pacific.”\n\nThis concept had China at its center – anathema for Abe who, like many Japanese, feared Beijing’s growing clout meant his country could be bullied by a far larger neighbor.\n\nAbe’s aim was to encourage the world to view Asia through a far wider lens – that of the “Indo-Pacific,” a concept spanning both the Indian and Pacific oceans that he first promoted in a 2007 speech to the Indian Parliament titled the “Confluence of the Two Seas.”\n\nThis rethinking of Asia’s boundaries did two things. Firstly, it shifted the geographical center to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea – conveniently focusing minds on an area of the world where Beijing has territorial disputes with a string of nations.\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, it brought into the picture the one country in the world that could act as a counterweight to China through its sheer size alone: India.\n\nJapan's helicopter carrier, the Huga, at a pier in Yokohama in 2009. Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBringing India into the fold\n\nAbe recognized “India’s importance as a democratic balancer to future Chinese hegemony” and “began systematically wooing Indian leaders to the framing,” wrote John Hemmings, of the East-West Center in Washington, in a 2020 evaluation of Abe that coincided with the end of his second stint as Prime Minister.\n\n“Including a democratic India in the future of Asia was not only good geopolitics, it was good geo-economics, as India’s population and democratic system balanced out China’s equally large population and authoritarian system.”\n\nAbe became a driving force behind the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, which brought India into a partnership with Japan, the US and Australia that launched the same year as his “Confluence of the Two Seas” speech.\n\nThe partnership has its roots in relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but it gained an “ideological component” in a 2006 campaign speech by Abe, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It was then reborn in 2007 as a strategic forum featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and –crucially – joint military drills that have met pushback from China.\n\nMonths later Abe outlined his vision of a “broader Asia … an immense network” spanning countries that share “fundamental values” such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests.\n\nThat description appeared to leave little room for China, which has felt threatened by the Quad ever since, and whose Foreign Minister Wang Yi has openly accused the US of trying to encircle China with an “Indo-Pacific NATO.”\n\nShinzo Abe meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the banks of the River Ganges at Varanasi in December 2015. Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA free and open Indo-Pacific\n\nWhen for a while it appeared China’s hostility might scupper the Quad, which fell apart in 2008 following threats of economic retaliation by Beijing, Abe played his hand once again.\n\nAccording to Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abe first outlined his vision for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” at a keynote speech in Kenya in 2016.\n\nHis vision consisted of three pillars: the promotion and establishment of the rule of law, freedom of navigation and free trade; the pursuit of economic prosperity; and a commitment to peace and stability.\n\nThe term acted “as a foil for Beijing’s increasingly China-centric vision of Asia’s future, while promoting openness and values to attract regional hedgers,” said Hemmings, of the East-West Center.\n\nThe year after Abe’s Kenya speech, the Quad was reborn – and the Trump administration unveiled its own concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nBy the time of Abe’s death the Quad had expanded significantly. In the past two years the four countries have held two joint naval exercises, convened around the mantra of promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nAbe’s legacy\n\nWriting after Abe’s death, Robert Ward, Japan chair of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted how Abe had restructured his country’s foreign policy, “driven by his quick recognition of the threat to Japan and the regional order from China’s rapid rise.”\n\nAs such, Ward wrote, it was “hard to overstate the transformational importance of his legacy, both inside and outside Japan.”\n\nThe breadth of Abe’s influence is clear from the tributes that followed his death.\n\nAmong the statesmen paying their respects was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – who has referred to Abe as a “dear friend” since meeting him in 2007, and declared last Saturday a day of national mourning in India for the former Japanese leader.\n\nTelling, too, were the tributes from the US – China’s biggest rival and Japan’s biggest military ally.\n\nUnder Abe, ties between the US and Japan had reached a “new level,” said Tobias Harris, senior fellow for Asia at the Center for American Progress, and this was reflected in President Joe Biden’s order that US flags be flown at half-staff at all public buildings in the country and all federal facilities around the world.\n\nIt was also reflected in the White House’s official tribute. Abe was “a faithful friend to the United States,” the White House said. “He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nJoe Biden meets Shinzo Abe in New York City in 2014. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nWords of remembrance\n\nThere’s that line again, “a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nThe phrase has become ubiquitous in US policy and military statements, while in 2018 the Pentagon’s Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii changed its name to Indo-Pacific Command to recognize “the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific oceans as America focuses West.”\n\nIn a speech titled “A Free and Open Indo-Pacific” in Indonesia last December, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would “work with our allies and partners to defend the rules-based order that we’ve built together over decades to ensure the region remains open and accessible.”\n\nThen at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used the term “rules-based order” or variants eight times.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida used the term 19 times as he explained Japan’s promotion of “a free and open Indo-Pacific” vision that had “come to gain broad support in the international community.”\n\nThat “broad support” may be Abe’s most enduring legacy. A tribute, in its own way, to the vision Abe had hinted at eight years earlier in his own speech to the Shangri La Dialogue.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken gives a speech titled \"A Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, in December 2021.

In the world of conservative Japanese politics, he was the bluest of blue bloods, a true princeling as the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, who had served as a powerful prime minister early in the post-World War II era. But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nAlready, as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the early 2000s when I first observed him, Abe had an aura of dynamism, self-confidence, and ambition. In the world of conservative Japanese politics, he was the bluest of blue bloods, a true princeling as the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, who had served as a powerful prime minister early in the post-World War II era. But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nI could sense this in the self-assured way that he handled briefings for journalists when he spoke extemporaneously and with muscular language. And I saw it even closer at hand in the way he handled arrangements for a rare summit in 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, between his boss at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.\n\nAbe personally took charge of some of the stickiest issues in this diplomacy, such as Japan’s quest to learn of the fate of Japanese citizens who had been allegedly abducted by North Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s as well as to recover the remains of those abductees who had died there. In Abe’s position as deputy chief cabinet secretary, many other politicians would have taken care to avoid the spotlight. But for Abe, who seemed to relish having the cameras on him, the challenge was avoiding getting too much attention.\n\nAbe was one of the first world leaders I covered who was roughly my own age. In 2006, his ambitions would be realized when he became the youngest prime minister in postwar Japan at age 52. His first stint in that office ended like that of most of his predecessors though, with a brief tenure that ended just a year later due to health problems. It is a mark of his remarkable drive that five years later, in 2012, he would return to office and end his career in 2020 as the longest-serving prime minister in the country’s history.\n\nHere, already, we can see hints of the many deep contradictions that this rare politician, brought down by a lone gunman, would come to embody. Abe’s dream was to modernize Japan—and to do so by modernizing his country’s politics. Operationally though, he always had a more fundamental—even inescapable—priority: to strengthen the position of the long dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that he led. Few truisms have been more accurate than the old saw that the LDP is neither liberal nor democratic.\n\nAbe succeeded in maintaining and arguably even strengthening his party’s near-stranglehold on power, but the LDP has never been keen on bold reform—and in some regards, this was true of Abe himself. Take, for example, his pledge to implement what he called “womenomics,” by which he meant making Japan “a place where women shine.” Despite the economic demographic urgency of welcoming women into the workplace as equals in pay and status, and even into the country’s defense forces, progress in this regard has been halting, and prominent LDP politicians frequently lapse into vulgar sexism in their public language.\n\nAbe liked the suffix “-nomics” and was even more deeply associated with a set of policies aimed at the competitive reinvigoration of his country, widely known as “Abenomics.” It is true that during his long tenure, the stock market leaped after a long period of stagnation, but economic inequality also widened substantially during his time in office. The jury is also out on the degree to which he succeeded in positioning Japan to compete with industrially dynamic neighbors, such as South Korea and especially China.\n\nIn purely political terms, Abe’s long second tenure in office seemed like it might mark a break with the endless cast of ephemeral LDP leaders who shuffled into and then promptly out of the prime minister’s office. But Abe’s immediate, handpicked successor, the rhetorically clumsy and faceless Yoshihide Suga, only held office from September 2020 until the following September. Abe clearly hoped to temper the effects of this chronic short termism at the top in Japanese politics by cultivating maximal influence as a godfather and éminence grise with at least one foot always prominently on stage, as his was during his deputyship under Koizumi. But with his death, that dream, too, is gone.\n\nIn foreign relations, Abe was the most active and dynamic Japanese political figure at least since Yasuhiro Nakasone, who spent five years as prime minister in the 1980s and struck up a close working relationship with, among other world leaders, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. For Abe’s part, he was quick to jump into his airplane and tireless in his personal diplomacy. This meant becoming the first foreign leader to visit with a then-newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York and having more in-person encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin than with any other world leader.\n\nAnd through sheer persistence, it meant overcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ostentatious disdain for Abe: The two finally met for the first time at a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in Beijing in 2014. The photograph of this first meeting is a classic and can be read in many ways. To me, despite his look of exhaustion, Abe seems to have a twinkle of satisfaction that he finally obtained a mano a mano with the powerful leader of the giant next door, whereas Xi’s face looks almost sheepish, as if he was thinking, “I can’t believe I’ve been brought to shake hands with this guy.”\n\nAbe and Xi stand side by side facing forward toward the camera while shaking hands.\n\nIn the end though, what did Abe’s force of persistence and personality win for Japan?\n\nMany in the U.S. foreign relations and national security worlds rushed forward to lionize Abe after his death. They celebrated his persistent efforts to strengthen the defense alliance with the United States, to become a much more active and muscular presence in the Asia Pacific region, to revise the Japanese Constitution (written by Americans during the postwar occupation of Japan), and above all—and related to each of these items—to help the United States by serving more directly as a bulwark to a rising China.\n\nBut here, even more than in other areas of Abe’s legacy, the contradictions abound. Arguably, the best thing Japan could do to improve its security would be to engineer with persistence and discipline a deep rapprochement with South Korea. Yet Abe’s family history—particularly as the grandson of Kishi, who barely escaped being judged as a war criminal—seemed to render this impossible for him.\n\nHis dream was instead to create what he called “forward-looking” relations with Korea and an unapologetic attitude toward his country’s past. That meant never abandoning the hope that he and future Japanese leaders could pray at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto abode for the spirits of the country’s war dead, explicitly including those condemned as criminals for their role in Japan’s imperial wars of the 20th century.\n\nEven as he pushed for closer ties with the United States, meanwhile, Abe clung to his belief in the noble intentions behind and even legitimacy of Japanese conquest—and therefore, the illegitimacy of the postwar trials and, by implication, the U.S. occupation and the Japanese Constitution written by the Americans, which forever forbids Japan from possessing an army that can pursue offensive war aims. But the same Japanese public that kept Abe in office for so long never followed him all the way down that road. Abe died still pushing for a revision of the so-called peace constitution, and in this regard, he died a frustrated man.\n\nIt will be for future generations of Japanese to decide just how far to go in recommitting toward an alliance with the United States. Whatever happens, China will always be Japan’s much larger—and for the foreseeable future, more economically and militarily powerful—neighbor. Japan trades more with China than with the United States, and in the case of conflict, it would be devastated by a Western-imposed sanctions regime on China along the lines of U.S.- and European-led efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. A U.S. shooting war with China would present Japan with even more terrifying choices. Is its alliance with Washington worth having Chinese missiles rain down on Japanese territory or sink Japanese vessels at sea?\n\nWe must all hope that things never come to this, but hope is not a strategy. There is a case to be made, as I argued in my 2017 book, Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power, that the period of maximal risk of war in East Asia spans the next couple of decades. After then, profound demographic change in China will cause Beijing to devote more and more of its wealth to retirement and social welfare payments at home and to pull back on its ambitions in the near and far overseas.\n\nUnder such a scenario, Abe’s vision for Japan becomes only one of several competing logics. Coming more fully to terms with its past and drawing closer to its neighbors—which is not to say turning away from the United States—seems like an equally obvious alternative possibility.",

In the world of conservative Japanese politics, he was the bluest of blue bloods, a true princeling as the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, who had served as a powerful prime minister early in the post-World War II era. But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nFrom my first close-up encounters with Japan’s recently assassinated former leader, Shinzo Abe, it was clear that this was a special politician—not just by the standards of a country with a revolving door of leaders whose shopworn look and turgid rhetoric earned them the diagnosis of sufferers of “metal fatigue” by critics but also by the standards of a world stage that, by that point in my career, I had become familiar with.\n\nAlready, as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the early 2000s when I first observed him, Abe had an aura of dynamism, self-confidence, and ambition.

But the forcefield of authority that seemed to surround Abe felt more like a personal attribute than an inherited one.\n\nI could sense this in the self-assured way that he handled briefings for journalists when he spoke extemporaneously and with muscular language. And I saw it even closer at hand in the way he handled arrangements for a rare summit in 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, between his boss at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.\n\nAbe personally took charge of some of the stickiest issues in this diplomacy, such as Japan’s quest to learn of the fate of Japanese citizens who had been allegedly abducted by North Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s as well as to recover the remains of those abductees who had died there. In Abe’s position as deputy chief cabinet secretary, many other politicians would have taken care to avoid the spotlight. But for Abe, who seemed to relish having the cameras on him, the challenge was avoiding getting too much attention.\n\nAbe was one of the first world leaders I covered who was roughly my own age. In 2006, his ambitions would be realized when he became the youngest prime minister in postwar Japan at age 52. His first stint in that office ended like that of most of his predecessors though, with a brief tenure that ended just a year later due to health problems. It is a mark of his remarkable drive that five years later, in 2012, he would return to office and end his career in 2020 as the longest-serving prime minister in the country’s history.\n\nHere, already, we can see hints of the many deep contradictions that this rare politician, brought down by a lone gunman, would come to embody. Abe’s dream was to modernize Japan—and to do so by modernizing his country’s politics. Operationally though, he always had a more fundamental—even inescapable—priority: to strengthen the position of the long dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that he led. Few truisms have been more accurate than the old saw that the LDP is neither liberal nor democratic.\n\nAbe succeeded in maintaining and arguably even strengthening his party’s near-stranglehold on power, but the LDP has never been keen on bold reform—and in some regards, this was true of Abe himself. Take, for example, his pledge to implement what he called “womenomics,” by which he meant making Japan “a place where women shine.” Despite the economic demographic urgency of welcoming women into the workplace as equals in pay and status, and even into the country’s defense forces, progress in this regard has been halting, and prominent LDP politicians frequently lapse into vulgar sexism in their public language.\n\nAbe liked the suffix “-nomics” and was even more deeply associated with a set of policies aimed at the competitive reinvigoration of his country, widely known as “Abenomics.” It is true that during his long tenure, the stock market leaped after a long period of stagnation, but economic inequality also widened substantially during his time in office. The jury is also out on the degree to which he succeeded in positioning Japan to compete with industrially dynamic neighbors, such as South Korea and especially China.\n\nIn purely political terms, Abe’s long second tenure in office seemed like it might mark a break with the endless cast of ephemeral LDP leaders who shuffled into and then promptly out of the prime minister’s office. But Abe’s immediate, handpicked successor, the rhetorically clumsy and faceless Yoshihide Suga, only held office from September 2020 until the following September. Abe clearly hoped to temper the effects of this chronic short termism at the top in Japanese politics by cultivating maximal influence as a godfather and éminence grise with at least one foot always prominently on stage, as his was during his deputyship under Koizumi. But with his death, that dream, too, is gone.\n\nIn foreign relations, Abe was the most active and dynamic Japanese political figure at least since Yasuhiro Nakasone, who spent five years as prime minister in the 1980s and struck up a close working relationship with, among other world leaders, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. For Abe’s part, he was quick to jump into his airplane and tireless in his personal diplomacy. This meant becoming the first foreign leader to visit with a then-newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York and having more in-person encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin than with any other world leader.\n\nAnd through sheer persistence, it meant overcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ostentatious disdain for Abe: The two finally met for the first time at a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in Beijing in 2014. The photograph of this first meeting is a classic and can be read in many ways. To me, despite his look of exhaustion, Abe seems to have a twinkle of satisfaction that he finally obtained a mano a mano with the powerful leader of the giant next door, whereas Xi’s face looks almost sheepish, as if he was thinking, “I can’t believe I’ve been brought to shake hands with this guy.”\n\nAbe and Xi stand side by side facing forward toward the camera while shaking hands.\n\nIn the end though, what did Abe’s force of persistence and personality win for Japan?\n\nMany in the U.S. foreign relations and national security worlds rushed forward to lionize Abe after his death. They celebrated his persistent efforts to strengthen the defense alliance with the United States, to become a much more active and muscular presence in the Asia Pacific region, to revise the Japanese Constitution (written by Americans during the postwar occupation of Japan), and above all—and related to each of these items—to help the United States by serving more directly as a bulwark to a rising China.\n\nBut here, even more than in other areas of Abe’s legacy, the contradictions abound. Arguably, the best thing Japan could do to improve its security would be to engineer with persistence and discipline a deep rapprochement with South Korea. Yet Abe’s family history—particularly as the grandson of Kishi, who barely escaped being judged as a war criminal—seemed to render this impossible for him.\n\nHis dream was instead to create what he called “forward-looking” relations with Korea and an unapologetic attitude toward his country’s past.

        "content": "The murder on 8 July 2022 of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe while campaigning for upcoming elections in the historic city of Nara, shocks both Japan and the world at large. Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations",

        "content": "Ecuador's first round of presidential voting in early February was unprecedented. Incumbent President Daniel Noboa and opposition leftist candidate Luisa González monopolized 90% of the vote, leaving the other 14 candidates with single-digit percentages and at least 12 who failed to reach even 1%. The atypical results came with an extraordinary period of violent threats and acts against politicians regardless of their leanings.\n\nLast December, President Noboa reported that the National Police had found a car bomb near a neighborhood in El Oro, where he had planned to make a campaign stop. González reported receiving death threats and placed her security in the hands of the nation's armed forces. Socialist candidate Pedro Granja suspended his campaign events after an attack. Centrist Jimmy Jairala's car was shot at the start of his campaign, and leftist candidate Andrea González decided to wear a bulletproof vest during her public appearances.\n\nViolence seems to be everywhere in Ecuador, affecting its education, health care, and politics. The candidates vying to lead the South American country—considered in recent years to be one of the most violent in the world—are well aware of this reality. Insecurity is the primary concern of their voters. Seven in 10 Ecuadorians fear going out at night, and the country ranks worst on Gallup's Law and Order Index, which annually measures the perception of security in 140 countries.\n\nViolence seems to be everywhere in Ecuador, affecting its education, health care, and politics\n\nOn April 13, when Noboa and González face off in the presidential runoff, violence could play an unparalleled role in voter decision-making.\n\nViolent threats against Ecuador's politicians are remnants of a deep national wound yet to heal. In August 2023, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated just ten days before the election. Since then, 30 politicians, including elected officials, have been murdered.\n\nThe security crisis complicates daily life even in places once considered safe havens, such as schools and hospitals. According to the Ministry of Education, approximately 90,000 children have dropped out of school since 2022, making Ecuador a record-holder as a country unfit for children. Homicide is the leading cause of death among Ecuadorian minors, and ever since criminal gangs normalized extorting students in exchange for permission to attend school, the NGO Plan International reports that 20% of children actively try to avoid classes due to fear of violence.\n\nAs schools become no-go zones, hospitals turn into cemeteries. The country had become accustomed to high levels of violence, averaging nearly 2,000 alerts of attacks in hospitals per year, according to the Ministry of Health. In recent months, doctors and hospital administrators have been murdered, kidnapped, and extorted, prompting authorities to take extreme measures, including to close a health-care center in Durán—a coastal city of nearly 400,000 people that, in 2023, was the homicide capital of the world.\n\nA patient suffering from COVID-19 receives medical attention at the Quito South Social Security Institute dining hall, in Quito, Ecuador, on April 9, 2021. REUTERS/Santiago Arcos\n\nEcuador's surge in violence is linked to the explosion of organized crime. Last November, The Economist dubbed Ecuador the world's newest narco-state. The reasons are plentiful. Judges, police officers, and prosecutors are accused of working for drug cartels. Three Ecuadorian cities rank among the 50 most violent in the world. According to Italy's ambassador to Ecuador, Giovanni Davoli, \"70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador.\" Davioli represents European security cooperation against the South American mafia. President Noboa estimated the \"size of Ecuador's criminal economy at around $30 billion USD\"—meaning that roughly one in every four dollars circulating in the country is tainted with blood and cocaine.\n\nBreaking the Cycle of Violence\n\nExperts such as former Army General Commander Luis Altamirano believe that Ecuador is stuck in a cycle of ineffective policies. In theory, the government has tried everything: border closures, states of emergency, declarations of internal armed conflict, harsher penalties, and international cooperation. Yet, after a brief slowdown during 2024, violent deaths are once again rising and are expected to break new records. \"There is no long-term vision for addressing the security problem,\" Altamirano reflects. \"We don't even know what the official public security policy is, nor what kind of reforms are planned—if any.\"\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter Sign up for our weekly newsletter to stay up to date.

Look for your next weekly newsletter in your inbox.\n\nAs these trends persist, the two leading candidates continue to blame each other. Noboa, who has governed for just a year and a half and seeks reelection for a full four-year term, argues that he has not had enough time to tackle the violence. He says he has faced opposition roadblocks and that his predecessors opened the doors to organized crime. González, on the other hand, accuses the incumbent president of lacking an action plan, improvising amid the security crisis, and dismantling the 2000s era crime-fighting policies of her party's former government—when, she claims, Ecuador was one of the safest countries in the region.\n\nWith weeks still left in the campaign and a presidential debate ahead, both candidates will be expected to move beyond vague rhetoric and broad statements on security. No matter who wins the most votes on April 13, Ecuadorians expect real results against violent crime.\n\nPeople leave after casting their votes at the Cesar Arroyo school during the presidential elections, in Cayambe, Ecuador, on August 20, 2023.

        "content": "A repeat of the January 6, 2021, assault on Congress is in my view unlikely. Trump is not in the White House and Kamala Harris, not Mike Pence, is the Vice President. Charging the Capitol building to prevent a peaceful transfer of power is pointless this time. In any case, the leaders of the groups that conspired to lead the mob in 2021 are not available to orchestrate another raid. They are in prison. Close to 1,300 January 6 rioters have been charged and prosecuted or are awaiting trial. Many did plea bargains that also will keep them at home.\n\nElection violence is almost guaranteed but it will be localized. We know this script. Self-deployed heavily armed militants will turn up at election sites and intimidate voters and election officials under the guise of “protecting” the election. Safeguarding the election against small-town vigilantes will be challenging. The Trump campaign, already anticipating a loss, is mobilizing a “Stop the Steal” campaign and preparing slates of fake electors who will reject certification should Harris win. Election officials and volunteers are already bombarded with death threats. The difference between a real threat and a ‘ha-ha’ threat is irrelevant when you are on the receiving end.

        "content": "A hard-won peace may be largely prevailing in the southern Philippines, but not all is quiet in the camps of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). As the region’s Muslim Moro people await the first ever and oft-delayed parliamentary elections of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the MILF, whose decades-long separatist armed struggle culminated in a peace agreement with the national government in 2014 and the creation of the BARMM in 2019, finds itself confronted by a violence older than that of its former adversaries from the national government: war between clans, traditionally called “rido.”\n\nIt is not the violence any ideologically committed MILF fighter had arguably signed up to confront, but it has claimed the lives of many a fighter. On 10 August 2022, for example, two factions of the MILF, each identified with rival clans, engaged in a firefight in Pikit town, Cotabato, in which four people were killed, including a civilian. The fighting led to the evacuation of hundreds of villagers and required the intervention of military, police, and local government officials to stop. Similarly, on 4 September 2024, the rival Aragasi and Usman clans, both affiliated with the MILF, engaged in a firefight in Parang town, Maguindanao del Norte, killing four. The fighting erupted over a long-running land dispute between the two clans.\n\nSuch fighting related to clan blood feuds concerns not only the MILF but also the wider Moro society. Precisely for this reason, it cannot be downplayed as a threat to the peace process, especially as the fate of the around 15,000 MILF fighters who have yet to undergo decommissioning depends on the success of the BARMM polls. The first polls — delayed multiple times for different reasons ranging from COVID-19 to (most recently) the belated exclusion of Sulu province from BARMM — are understood to be the completion of the government and MILF’s mutual commitments to each other under the 2014 peace agreement. The peace process is thus entering a critical homestretch that demands just enough calm from all armed stakeholders for a full-fledged autonomous government to emerge — through the ballot box rather than through arms.\n\nThe MILF is not unaware of the persistent challenge rido poses to its own ranks and has tried for years to resolve clan conflicts between its members. When the MILF announced the end of two clan wars in 2011, it acknowledged that such rido conflicts are obstacles to peace. Later, in June 2020, the MILF celebrated its resolution of what it called the biggest rido in the formerly unified Maguindanao province (split into Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur in 2022). At the time, the MILF asserted that the peace agreement between the Sindatok and Tundok clans, which respectively led the MILF’s 105th and 118th Base Commands, would eliminate “half of the rido problem in Maguindanao.”\n\nAll eyes are now waiting to see whether the MILF will do better than its historical predecessor, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), in dealing with rido. The MNLF, founded in 1972, signed its own peace agreement with the national government in 1996 and consequently governed the earlier Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) region that preceded BARMM. The MNLF-led ARMM was largely seen as a failure, not only because the MILF (which had split from the MNLF by 1977 over strategic differences) continued its rebellion, but also because the MNLF was seen to have failed in asserting political legitimacy over powerful local clans. Rido now threatens to once again be a stumbling block to the MILF and the national government’s efforts to establish a lasting peace in Mindanao.\n\nRido violence and clan-based social structures in BARMM\n\nRido violence is traditionally defined as clan-based violence between Moro Muslim clans. The existence of rido itself illustrates the strong clan-based dynamics that persist in the region, which far predate the separatist political movements that shaped Mindanao’s political history over the last few decades. ACLED records over 150 rido events since 2018. Unsurprisingly, most rido violence persists in present-day BARMM, which accounts for around 80% of all such events since 2018, but also to a significant degree in the neighboring Soccsksargen region (see map below). Most such events have no relation to MILF or other armed group activity.\n\nUsing reports of violent events from local and national media, ACLED has recorded violent incidents related to rido from 2018 onward. ACLED classifies events as rido-related if a report on political violence explicitly refers to rido as the cause or likely cause. On rare occasions when reports do not explicitly refer to rido, they may still use very similar language, referring to “clan blood feuds” or fighting between clans in the Muslim-majority part of Mindanao, the traditional homeland of the Moro people. This area is now mostly in present-day BARMM, but rido events have also been recorded in neighboring regions, including Soccsksargen, Northern Mindanao, and Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\nSurveying ACLED data on rido violence reveals its multifaceted nature. Motives for specific outbreaks of violence range from the overtly political to the decidedly personal. Given the overall security implications and social significance of rido in clan-based Mindanao society, all such events are included in the ACLED dataset, whether they are attributed to electoral competition or a personal grudge.\n\nOne of the most cited reasons for deadly rido violence is competition over land. A firefight between the rival Impos and Magao clans on 18 September 2020, which killed two militiamen from each group, is a typical example of a clan-based dispute over land that turned lethal. But land is not the only reason cited in outbreaks of violence. For example, in April 2021, a member of the Jaljalis clan was killed by Aspali clan militiamen in Sumisip town, Basilan, after he was caught having an affair with the Aspali clan leader’s sister-in-law. The Jaljalis clan then retaliated, resulting in the death of an Aspali clan member. Meanwhile, on 10 November 2024, two cousins were reportedly killed and two others wounded in a clash between clans in Balabagan town, Lanao del Sur. The fight stemmed from a simple argument over Facebook posts. The relatives of the slain cousins retaliated by setting fire to a truck owned by the opposing side.\n\nThere are even cases reported as rido that may not involve fighting between two Moro clans. But even these cases are rooted in the complicated history of Mindanao, including the central state’s policy of resettling non-Moro Muslim people in the territory throughout the 20th century. Thus, on 25 January 2017, three members of an Ilonggo clan — non-Muslim people originating from Western Visayas in the central Philippines — were injured in a rido-related ambush by a Moro family in Sultan Kudarat town, Maguindanao. The resettling of non-Muslim (typically Christian) Filipinos throughout Mindanao that began during the American colonial era, and the resulting displacement of Moro Muslims, is one of the historical grievances that led to the Moro rebellion that began in the 1970s.\n\nThese are but a handful of examples of rido-related fighting, but there is reason to believe that rido — while highly researched by scholars — is a significantly underreported phenomenon, given that most rido incidents happen in remote places that might not always receive media attention. Thus, while ACLED data indicate a rise in rido events in the past years (see graph below), ACLED’s reports-based figure is likely an undercount. In any case, the establishment of transitional MILF-led BARMM institutions in 2019 failed to stem rido-related violence.\n\nRido interaction with other conflicts\n\nACLED data show that the persistence of rido violence in BARMM and surrounding regions often also involves actors with identities that are not inherently centered on rido, the most prominent of which are the MILF and MNLF.\n\nWhen university-educated ideologues first started waging the separatist armed struggle for the Moro people in the 1970s, giving birth first to the MNLF and later the MILF, these early revolutionaries couched their groups’ ideological language in the ideals of self-determination. But while these national separatist struggles appealed to globalized norms of self-determination, local realities play a decisive role in how such appeals turn out. The scholarship on violence in Bangsamoro has thus focused on the difficulty that new democratic structures face in establishing their political legitimacy vis-à-vis more traditional sources of political legitimacy, such as clans.\n\nThe MILF and MNLF movements in Mindanao have historically sought to frame their projects of political autonomy in the same terms as, paradoxically, the national state they opposed: the creation of modern political institutions that fulfill the responsibilities expected of a state. Thus, even with the shift of their political projects from full separatism to regional autonomy, the MILF and the MNLF now align themselves with the central state, as well as international development cooperation agencies, in embracing the language of “good governance” as the solution to social ills.\n\nHowever, implementing international democratic norms locally will not automatically dislodge a society’s traditional sources of political legitimacy. Local populations still need convincing that new institutions will respond to their needs better than, say, the powerful local clans that previously guaranteed their security and livelihood. Such institutions will thus have to be proven more “legitimate” than the clans. In the case of Bangsamoro, good governance advocates now working in the framework of rebel-won autonomy therefore risk a disconnect with local communities if they ignore the traditional clan-based power structures, which far precede the rebellions.\n\nWhat is at stake is the very authority of the rebels-turned-leaders now at the helm of the supposedly innovative and democratic new autonomous region. Their authority is quickly undermined when the violence emanating from the traditional clan-based power structures remains unchecked. This is especially true given that other armed actors otherwise engaged in conflict outside the framework of rido also take part in clan-based violence, affirming the stubborn political centrality of clans.\n\nAs ACLED data from 2018 onward show, a third of rido violence has involved the MILF, MNLF, and other armed groups, such as Abu Sayyaf and Dawlah Islamiyah affiliates like the Hassan Group, on at least one side of a clash (see graph below). Abu Sayyaf is a long-standing Islamist fundamentalist group with historic ties to al-Qaeda, while Dawlah Islamiyah is a loose umbrella term for several Islamic State-inspired groups that first rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and reached a height of activity during the 2017 siege on Marawi city. Though these diverse groups are largely connected only by their presence in Mindanao, one commonality is that none of them was inherently constituted to engage in rido violence.\n\nThe armed group whose members are most involved in rido violence is the MILF itself. In fact, of all the political violence events that have seen at least some MILF involvement since 2018, 35% are related to rido. This figure represents a considerable strain on the MILF-led BARMM’s credibility in managing rido violence in the region. It also highlights how the interconnectedness of different conflicts in Bangsamoro means that the resources available to an armed group may also play a role in pursuing goals external to the group. After all, the MILF members involved were ostensibly armed in service of the MILF’s ideological goals of political autonomy for Moro Muslims. But their implication in rido violence shows that they may also be using their weapons to serve other purposes. Rido thus compounds the volume of violence attributable to an armed group, even if such violence lies outside a group’s self-understanding.\n\nRido may even play a role in the occasional clashes that break out between armed groups, which otherwise — apart from the MILF and the MNLF, since their respective peace agreements with the government — would normally engage only in armed clashes with state forces. For example, on 11 September 2023, two Dawlah Islamiyah–Hassan Group militants were reportedly killed and three others wounded in a firefight with the MILF in Datu Hoffer Ampatuan town in Maguindanao del Sur. The fighting caused Teduray tribespeople to evacuate. Authorities directly blamed a long-standing rido for the fighting between the Dawlah Islamiyah and the MILF militants.\n\nMNLF fighters, too, have engaged in firefights with the MILF. Two rival clans, respectively affiliated with the MILF and the MNLF, fought in several villages in Pikit town, Cotabato, on 10 May 2020. Despite no reports of casualties, the effects of the violence were not confined to the fighters, as the rival militias burned homes and looted property and livestock in the area. The local government, and both the MILF and MNLF, intervened to end the fighting, which was attributed to a land dispute.\n\nThese examples show that armed groups may sometimes be pulled into patterns of violence with a longer history than their own.\n\nThe threat of rido violence to the BARMM elections and the larger peace process\n\nElevated levels of violence have historically accompanied election periods in the Philippines, and the first-ever Bangsamoro parliamentary election is not likely to be different. In fact, several rido events have been attributed to electoral competition, and at least 26 rido-related attacks have been directed against elected representatives and other local state officials since 2018. Some specific rido-related events have also been expressly attributed to electoral competition. For example, on 24 September 2024, two individuals were reportedly killed in a clash between the Abdul and Macud clans in Malabang town, Lanao del Sur. The incident also wounded four people and led hundreds of residents to flee. The conflict was said to originate from a dispute during the 2019 local elections between the two clans.\n\nThe question for the 2025 BARMM polls would then be whether the powerful clans participating in the parliamentary elections are going to keep such competition to the ballot box or resort to violence in an attempt to influence the results. The single most prominent player in the upcoming elections is, of course, the MILF itself. Though it is officially participating in the polls through its organizationally separate affiliated political party, the United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP), the MILF and its remaining armed strength of about 15,000 fighters remain this party’s backbone. After all, in line with the 2014 peace agreement, the full decommissioning process of MILF fighters is not expected to be finished until the completion of the peace process, which is meant to be capped by the polls. So far, around 25,000 MILF fighters have been decommissioned by the third of four decommissioning phases as of 2023. Government officials have publicly announced their intent to complete the decommissioning process, which includes third-party international observers, right in time for the BARMM parliamentary elections. With the postponement of the polls, now scheduled for October 2025, the decommissioning progress is presently unclear.\n\nBARMM politicians who are unaffiliated with the MILF have expressed concern about the group’s continued armed strength going into the polls, as the official decommissioning protocol of the 2014 peace agreement only provides for the decommissioning of 35% of all MILF fighters by the third (pre-final) phase. In 2023, four BARMM provincial governors called on the government to hasten the decommissioning process. The governors argued that the MILF’s armed presence, coupled with the “peace process mechanisms” in place, barred police and military from implementing law enforcement operations in areas considered “MILF territory.” During the 2019 autonomy plebiscite that established the BARMM, some quarters also expressed fears about a possible outbreak of violence in case Cotabato City, now the BARMM capital, did not vote to join the then-proposed autonomous region, given the city’s symbolic importance for the MILF.\n\nIn contrast to politicians publicly expressing concern about the MILF’s continued armed strength, the group has instead pointed to powerful local politicians’ private armies as the threat to peace and order. Responding to the BARMM governors’ call, MILF leader and former BARMM Chief Minister Ahod “Murad” Ebrahim said there was no problem with a faster decommissioning, but he emphasized the need for a corresponding dismantling of politicians’ private armies.\n\nWith MILF members themselves often involved in armed clashes between clans, third-party observers have emphasized the mutual importance of decommissioning MILF fighters and dismantling clans’ private armies. On the same track, the government has stressed the importance of instituting nonviolent resolution mechanisms for rido disputes to protect the gains of the peace process. The MILF-led Bangsamoro transitional government has therefore engaged in regionwide consultation efforts for the prevention and settlement of rido disputes.\n\nThese efforts notwithstanding, the history of election-related violence in the Philippines gives reason for concern that a heightened risk of violence during the elections could be posed by confluent factors, including electoral competition between clans, electoral participation of a heavily armed MILF, and the presence of clan militias and private armies across BARMM.\n\nTensions will run especially high given that powerful and influential clans are fielding their members to contest the parliamentary elections. Some have even banded together to form larger coalitions to face off with the MILF’s own party — though the alliances seem to be fluid and shifting. For example, three of four regionally prominent clans that previously allied as the Bangsamoro Grand Coalition to contest the UBJP in the October 2025 polls later declared allegiance to the UBJP.\n\nIn the face of persistent rido violence, the future Bangsamoro government will be tasked with the tall order of convincing its Moro constituents — including the powerful clans that make up its elite — that the new institutions and mechanisms will serve as a more effective recourse than rido in solving the disputes that shape Moro social life. The elections promise to be the first test. Their success will require just enough faith in the future of Bangsamoro for the MILF and clan-based militias to lay down their arms.",

        "content": "Many Americans are worried that if former President Donald Trump loses to Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, he and his Make American Great Again (MAGA) supporters will cry foul, and some may engage in violence. Almost two-thirds of Republicans believe that Trump won four years ago, and they may say the same thing this year if Harris wins. Trump himself has fed this red meat to his base, saying on several occasions that the only way he will lose is if the election is rigged.\n\nA repeat of the violence at the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021, when legislators met to formally approve the electoral college results of President Joe Biden’s victory, is unlikely to occur because Biden will still be in office for the January 6, 2025 counting and certification of the 2024 results. Unlike Trump’s actions as president in January 2021, Biden is already overseeing heightened security measures for January 6 and will move quickly to provide security around this venerable institution and denounce and shut down violence. But there is a good chance that sporadic acts of violence could occur against other individuals and institutions. Violence is possible against Harris supporters, immigrants, minorities, and others if Trump loses and refuses to accept the results, and his diehard supporters vent their anger in dangerous ways.\n\nThe Erosion of Norms, Standards, and Decorum\n\nOne of the hallmarks of American democracy has been the peaceful transfer of power after elections. Although no politician likes to lose, for nearly two and a half centuries, with the exception of the events leading up to the Civil War in the early 1860s, the defeated presidential candidate has conceded the race to his opponent after most of the votes have been counted, often in a gracious way, as former Republican candidate John McCain did in 2008. Even when a candidate and his supporters have suspected foul play—for example, in the very tight 1960 presidential election, some of Richard Nixon’s Republican party supporters believed that Democratic Mayor Richard Daley rigged the vote count in Chicago in order for John F. Kennedy to carry the state of Illinois—there was no violence in the election aftermath. Indeed, none other than Nixon himself, who was known as “Tricky Dick” to his detractors and later had to resign in disgrace in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, told a close confidant at the time that he would not contest the 1960 election outcome because “our country cannot afford the agony of a constitutional crisis.” Nixon seemed to believe that, in the interests of preserving American democracy, it was better to concede to Kennedy than to challenge the results.\n\nTrump has thrown such commendable behavior out the window. Not only did he refuse to concede to Biden after the 2020 contest, in an election that was deemed not fraudulent by his own attorney general, William Barr, he even tried to pressure Georgia state officials shortly after the election to “find” him the necessary votes to win that state. Trump’s campaign filed scores of lawsuits to contest the results in various states, but they were all dismissed by the courts. Nonetheless, Trump and most of his supporters refused to accept the fact that Biden won the election, and Trump did not even attend Biden’s inauguration ceremony as is customary.\n\nBut the most egregious post-election action was the storming of the US Capitol by thousands of Trump’s supporters on January 6, 2021, to disrupt the formal count of the electoral college vote and to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to Biden. Trump had urged them on, even knowing that some were armed. It later came to light in congressional hearings that Trump watched television in the White House for several hours while his supporters were engaged in violence, and did not seem to care that his own Vice President Mike Pence, who had a constitutional duty to certify the electoral college results, was in danger from a mob chanting “hang Mike Pence.”\n\nIn the current election cycle, Trump has said repeatedly he would pardon the January 6 rioters, hundreds of whom have already been convicted by the courts, with many still serving jail time, and has called them “warriors.” Trump has even referred to January 6, 2021, a “day of love.”\n\nIn addition, Trump has lowered the bar on speech, charging that Harris has low intelligence and has been a “[expletive] vice president.” It is not surprising, therefore, that Trump’s supporters have echoed this and other profanities at his rallies and have demonized Harris and her supporters. Trump has mentioned that some religious leaders, who are part of his support base, have urged him to stop using such profanity, but suggested that his speeches would not be as effective, which his crowds love to hear. Trump also engages in ludicrous and harmful rhetoric by claiming that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating the pets of the residents of that town. Trump seems to have special animus for migrants from poor, non-white majority countries which, he claims, are emptying their societies of criminals and mentally impaired people and sending them to the United States.\n\nTrump seems to have special animus for migrants from poor, non-white majority countries.\n\nFor her part, Harris has stated that she agrees with Trump’s former White House chief of staff, retired General John Kelly, that Trump fits the definition of a “fascist.” Even the democratic socialist US senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, has said he prefers not to use the word fascist when describing Trump. The derogatory labeling by Trump and Harris of each other is indicative of how nasty this close election has become.\n\nRepeat of the January 6 Attack Is Unlikely…\n\nBecause Biden will still be president on January 6, 2025, he will be in charge, as head of the executive branch, of providing the necessary security to protect the Capitol building in case Trump loses and his supporters again try to pressure lawmakers not to certify the electoral college results. Already, there have been practice drills of 12 helicopters landing on US Capitol grounds to boost security in case rioters attempt to storm the Capitol again. But because so many of the January 6 insurrectionists have been sentenced to jail, and knowing that they would face a formidable security presence this time around, Trump’s diehard supporters are unlikely to repeat their 2021 actions.\n\n…But Violence is Likely in Other Places\n\nNonetheless, emotions are so raw in this very tight presidential election (the polls suggest a dead heat, nearly all of which are within the margin of error) that if Trump loses, many of his supporters may claim that it was rigged and will demand “justice.” According to a January 2024 poll, about 66 percent of Trump supporters believed he won in 2020, implying that Biden is not a legitimate president. Teams of lawyers have been assembled by the Trump and Harris campaigns to report violations of the vote or to challenge the other side’s claims of fraud. In early August, the Republican-controlled state election board of Georgia adopted a rule that requires local election board members to conduct an undefined “reasonable inquiry” into any discrepancies before they can certify an election. The rule is so broad that the final election tally for the state could be held up for days.\n\nTrump has stirred up his base into believing that he would only lose if the other side cheats.\n\nIn addition to such legal maneuvers is Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric in which he claims that the only way he will lose the election is if it is fraudulent. In a prerecorded video that was shown every night of the 2024 Republican convention, Trump said,“ The most important thing we have to do is protect the vote. You have to keep your eyes open because these people [Democrats] want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it’s the only thing they do well.” Not surprisingly, even in the state of Virginia, which both Democrats and Republicans have won in recent years, only a little less than half of Trump supporters (48 percent) say they would be willing to accept a Harris presidency if she wins the election.\n\nTrump has stirred up his base into believing that he would only lose if the other side cheats, frequently using an undefined “they,” such as “they are coming after you.” Trump’s MAGA supporters could attack election poll workers, those involved in the counting of ballots, and state elections officials who would certify a Harris victory.\n\nIn addition, immigrants could be targeted, and not just those who have entered or stayed in the country illegally. During the presidential debate, Trump claimed without evidence that “our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote.” Trump’s previous comments about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the country as well as more recent comments that he (and his supporters) have made claiming falsely that funds for the victims of Hurricane Helene that severely affected the southern parts of Appalachia were being diverted to services for illegal immigrants may also encourage violence. In addition, because many minority group voters, like Black and Latino voters, may favor Harris over Trump, sporadic acts of violence directed at some of them could occur if Trump loses.\n\nWarnings by Biden and Experts on Extremism\n\nThe past October, when Biden was asked about the upcoming election, he said he was confident it would be free and fair but added, “I don’t know whether it’ll be peaceful.” This comment was partly political, reflecting his belief that Trump is ginning up his base to contest the election result if he loses to Harris. But it also may reflect briefings that the president has received from law enforcement agencies about the potential for violence.\n\nIndeed, experts who have been monitoring extremist groups ahead of the election, such as those from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), have highlighted a boost in online chatter that mirrored the situation in the run-up to the 2020 vote and the January 6 attack. In October, GPAHE noted that violent rhetoric related to election denialism has increased significantly on extremist online platforms.\n\nThere is boost in online chatter that mirrors the situation in the run-up to the 2020 vote and the January 6 attack.\n\nOn one such platform, Gab, users have threatened those alleged to have engaged in election fraud with treason, and called for “firing squads” or “the rope” to deal with them. Other extremist posts on Telegram have used election denialism to justify acts of violence, for example urging users to “shoot to kill any illegal voters.” Although organized extremist groups undoubtedly know that they are being monitored by law enforcement agencies, rhetoric on such platforms may inspire so-called lone wolves to commit individual acts of violence.\n\nAnd Worry by Ordinary Americans\n\nAccording to recent polling, about 57 percent of Americans in battleground states are very or somewhat worried that Trump supporters will turn to violence if he loses. These sentiments and threats have led to increased security for voters, election workers, and election infrastructure in these and other states. The Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, Mark Rozell, has said that these polling numbers underscore that “we cannot assume that people will accept the legitimacy of the election, and that a peaceful transfer of power is something that just automatically happens here.”\n\nThat indeed is a sad reflection of politics in the United States at present. It is hoped that government institutions will not only work to protect citizens in this highly charged atmosphere but also will be a hedge against dubious charges of fraud such as the claim that illegal immigrants are voting. But it will also take courageous individual public servants to stand their ground. Some of them did so last time, and the hope is that they will do so again. A presidential election marred by intimidation and violence will not only be a blight on America’s democracy at home but also will hurt its standing abroad.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Shutterstock/Sebastian Portillo",

        "summary": "The article discusses concerns about potential violence following the November 5 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Trump has repeatedly claimed the election will be rigged if he loses, leading to fears of a repeat of the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. While a similar large-scale event at the Capitol is deemed unlikely due to heightened security, sporadic acts of violence against Harris supporters, immigrants, minorities, and election workers are possible. Experts note increased extremist online chatter mirroring the lead-up to the 2020 election and January 6. A poll indicates that a majority of Americans are worried about potential violence from Trump supporters if he loses. Both Trump and Harris have engaged in derogatory labeling of each other, escalating tensions.\n"
