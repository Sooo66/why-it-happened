Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded.\n    *   **Bangladesh:** Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar are highly vulnerable, with health authorities preparing for a possible outbreak. Internet and phone restrictions hinder communication efforts.\n*   **Africa:**\n    *   Travel restrictions prevent humanitarian staff and cargo delivery. Troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.\n    *   **Horn of Africa:** First cases of COVID-19 registered, and rumors and false information spread due to weak health infrastructure. Phone and internet shutdowns restrict information access in Ethiopia. Somalia's health system is ravaged by conflict, testing is delayed, and Al-Shabaab limits access.\n    *   **Central Africa:** Nigeria and Cameroon have reported cases, with concerns for IDPs who lack access to clean water or healthcare.\n    *   **Sahel:** Conflict and population movement across borders increases risks. Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger are affected, and humanitarian funding is short.\n    *   **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Over 5 million displaced persons, DRC grapples with COVID-19 in addition to the end of the two-year-long Ebola outbreak.\n    *   **South Sudan:** No cases reported yet, but vulnerable due to food insecurity and poor health infrastructure. International flights suspended. UN peacekeeping mission presence poses risk.\n*   **The Americas:**\n    *   Government responses vary widely.\n    *   **U.S. Border:** Border closures impact asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors and prevent humanitarian workers from bringing critical supplies to Mexico.\n    *   **Mexico:** Mexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people with inadequate health screenings and overcrowding of migrants.\n    *   **Central America:** Civilians prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Deportations continue despite risks of spreading the virus.\n    *   **Venezuela:** Economic collapse and political turmoil have left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse. Maduro called for sanctions relief, received aid from China and Cuba. The pandemic could exacerbate the pre-existing humanitarian crisis.\n    *   **Colombia:** Colombia hosts the largest number of displaced Venezuelans.\n    *   **Other Regional Countries Hosting Venezuelans:** Border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries.\n*   **Europe:**\n    *   Countries close borders to asylum seekers.\n    *   **Italy:** Strict lockdown is difficult for refugees and asylum seekers. Government suspended interviews for refugee status determination.\n    *   **Greece:** Shutdown of asylum system and appalling conditions on Aegean Islands.

Security arrested the suspected gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami. Yamagami fired two shots at Abe; the second shot hit Abe's chest and neck. Abe died several hours later. Yamagami attacked Abe due to Abe's association with a group Yamagami hated. Tributes were given by President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Abe worked to build up Japan's military and reform the economy. Abe failed to revise Japan's constitution but passed legislation allowing Japan's military to expand operations overseas. Abe was a critic of China and called on the US to give Taiwan assurances of help in the event of an attack by China.\n", "Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot while delivering a campaign speech in Nara. The attack occurred at approximately 11:30 a.m. before upper house elections. Abe collapsed, bleeding from the neck and chest. He was taken to a hospital in cardiac arrest and pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. due to excessive bleeding; a bullet reached his heart. Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, was arrested for attempted murder; police recovered a gun, possibly homemade. Witnesses reported hearing two gunshots.

The shooting involved a gun, rare in Japan due to stringent firearm laws. Gun violence is almost unheard-of in Japan, with only one firearm-related death in 2021. The shooter used a handmade gun, which was seized along with several others at his home. Japan's firearms laws are strict, requiring a 12-step process to purchase a gun. Political assassinations were common before WWII, but rare since; the last killing of a national political figure was in 1960. Light police protection at political events allowed the shooter unobstructed access.

The epicenter was near Sagaing and Mandalay. Violent shaking was felt by millions, and the USGS issued a Red alert, predicting high casualties and extensive damage. Liquefaction and landslides were triggered. Buildings collapsed in Mandalay and roads buckled in Naypyidaw. Over 1,000 deaths and 2,400 injuries were reported initially. National phone and internet infrastructure was disrupted. Approximately 2,970 residential buildings, 150 religious structures, 30 roads, and 7 bridges were destroyed or severely damaged. Many mosques and monasteries collapsed, resulting in deaths during prayer time and trapping monks. Mandalay was severely affected, with at least 674 deaths and over 1,000 missing and more than half of the city’s buildings severely damaged or destroyed. Significant damage occurred to Mandalay University, the Dokhtawaddy Bridge, Mandalay Palace and Sagaing Township experienced widespread structural failure. In Naypyidaw, 204 fatalities were confirmed, with damage to government buildings and the airport control tower. In Shan State, at least 60 deaths were reported. In Bago Region, school and shelter collapses caused fatalities. Yangon experienced limited damage. In Thailand, at least 10 people were killed, 68 injured and 90 missing, with building collapses in Bangkok and suspension of transit and trading.

States of emergency were declared.\n", "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar in Mandalay at 6.21am GMT, originating at a shallow depth of 10km. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse and roads to buckle in Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a climbing death toll. The quake occurred due to strike-slip faulting on the Sagaing fault between the India and Eurasia plates. The Indian plate moved north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate. The region has experienced similar large earthquakes in the past. The moment magnitude scale is used to measure the earthquake, which is logarithmic. A large aftershock occurred, and more are expected, posing challenges to rescuers. The China Earthquake Networks Center reported the earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China's Yunnan province.\n", "A 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar on Friday, causing damage.

Bangkok is vulnerable to tremors due to its tall buildings.\n", "An earthquake struck Myanmar, prompting a rare plea for international humanitarian aid from the military government. The military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, stated their willingness to cooperate with the international community. Myanmar faces challenges in aid delivery due to its isolation since the 2021 coup and prior sanctions. The UN is mobilizing aid, but logistical hurdles remain due to the ongoing civil war. Michael Martin highlights security risks for aid workers and potential military interference, including preventing access to rebel areas and manipulating aid distribution. Stefan Dercon points out challenges in transferring funds and logistical complexities. Fundraising may also be difficult due to Myanmar's isolation. The extent of U.S. government aid is uncertain.\n", "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, followed by multiple aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7.

In Myanmar, at least 144 deaths and over 732 injuries were reported. A mosque in Taungnoo partially collapsed, killing at least 3. The Mahamuni Buddha Temple and the former royal palace in Mandalay were damaged. Myanmar's military leader appealed for international aid. India sent 15 tonnes of relief material. A state of emergency was declared in several regions.\n\nIn Thailand, a skyscraper under construction collapsed in Bangkok, resulting in at least 10 deaths, 16 injuries, and over 100 missing.

National phone and internet infrastructure was disrupted. Approximately 2,970 residential buildings, 150 religious structures, 30 roads, and 7 bridges were destroyed or severely damaged. Many mosques and monasteries collapsed, resulting in deaths during prayer time and trapping monks. Mandalay was severely affected, with at least 674 deaths and over 1,000 missing and more than half of the city’s buildings severely damaged or destroyed. Significant damage occurred to Mandalay University, the Dokhtawaddy Bridge, Mandalay Palace and Sagaing Township experienced widespread structural failure. In Naypyidaw, 204 fatalities were confirmed, with damage to government buildings and the airport control tower. In Shan State, at least 60 deaths were reported. In Bago Region, school and shelter collapses caused fatalities. Yangon experienced limited damage. In Thailand, at least 10 people were killed, 68 injured and 90 missing, with building collapses in Bangkok and suspension of transit and trading.

States of emergency were declared.\n", "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar in Mandalay at 6.21am GMT, originating at a shallow depth of 10km. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse and roads to buckle in Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a climbing death toll. The quake occurred due to strike-slip faulting on the Sagaing fault between the India and Eurasia plates. The Indian plate moved north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate. The region has experienced similar large earthquakes in the past. The moment magnitude scale is used to measure the earthquake, which is logarithmic. A large aftershock occurred, and more are expected, posing challenges to rescuers. The China Earthquake Networks Center reported the earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China's Yunnan province.\n", "A 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar on Friday, causing damage. The Mandalay General Hospital is full and no longer admitting patients, and is without power and water. The earthquake was caused by a rupture lasting a full minute, causing sideways movements.

Bangkok is vulnerable to tremors due to its tall buildings.\n", "An earthquake struck Myanmar, prompting a rare plea for international humanitarian aid from the military government. The military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, stated their willingness to cooperate with the international community. Myanmar faces challenges in aid delivery due to its isolation since the 2021 coup and prior sanctions. The UN is mobilizing aid, but logistical hurdles remain due to the ongoing civil war. Michael Martin highlights security risks for aid workers and potential military interference, including preventing access to rebel areas and manipulating aid distribution. Stefan Dercon points out challenges in transferring funds and logistical complexities. Fundraising may also be difficult due to Myanmar's isolation.

Trump argues tariffs will balance the economic playing field and encourage domestic manufacturing. Economists generally believe tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and retaliatory tariffs. Trump wants to use tariffs to force other countries to lower their tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and on imported autos and auto parts. The specifics of the tariffs to be announced on April 2 remain unclear. Negotiations with Canada are possible. The U.S. has a trade deficit. Trump believes this proves the U.S. is treated unfairly. Tariffs could pull more business into the U.S. or lead to a recession.\n", "President Trump admires the Gilded Age (1870-1913), particularly President William McKinley's era, due to its high tariffs. Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893.

Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n", "Prior to last year's American election, voters frequently cited \"the economy\" as their top motivator.

Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n", "Prior to last year's American election, voters frequently cited \"the economy\" as their top motivator.

However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n", "Prior to last year's American election, voters frequently cited \"the economy\" as their top motivator. Now, eight weeks into Trump's presidency, \"chaos\", \"uncertainty\" and a possible \"recession\" are dominating economic discussions due to Trump's tariffs policy. Trump is using tariffs to advance his \"America First\" trade policy and to pressure world leaders. Tariffs were placed on aluminium and steel, angering Australia. Trump imposed tariffs on Colombia when its president refused to accept deportees, leading to the country's compliance. Trump has complained about uneven trade relationships with China, Canada, and Mexico, using tariffs to address trade deficits, fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration. China responded with retaliatory tariffs, while Canada and Mexico initially toughened border controls. Trump postponed, then implemented tariffs on Canada and Mexico, leading to accusations of crippling Canada's economy. Canada, China and Mexico have imposed retaliatory tariffs. Investor uncertainty and tariff-fuelled recession fears have caused American stocks to decline. Some businesses are increasing prices, and significant price increases are expected on European alcohol. Consumer sentiment crashed, with a University of Michigan survey showing an 11% drop in a month. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 70% of Americans expect tariffs to increase consumer prices.

Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms.

Trump believes tariffs and low interest rates can reduce federal debt and boost domestic manufacturing. He advocates for modern protectionism, suggesting tariffs could replace the federal income tax. Experts argue Trump idealizes a time of corruption and inequality, overestimating tariffs' role in economic growth. Trump increased tariffs on imports from China, aluminum, and steel, and plans further increases, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nExperts note that McKinley's era had government budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, McKinley differed with Trump by using tariffs as a bludgeon. McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which raised import taxes, leading to inflation and Republican losses in the 1890 midterms. He later won the presidency in 1896.\n\nPost Civil-War, the US ran budget surpluses due to tariffs. However, budget surpluses decreased the US money supply causing deflation, and tariffs increased the cost of living which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893. Unemployment reached 25% nationally.\n\nMcKinley also advocated expansionism, acquiring territories like the Philippines and Guam. McKinley shifted towards reciprocity in trade before being assassinated in 1901.\n", "Prior to last year's American election, voters frequently cited \"the economy\" as their top motivator.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "David Cameron announced his resignation as Prime Minister.", "event2_context": ["On June 24, 2016, British Prime Minister David Cameron stated that the British people voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.

The UK public perceived the EU as inefficient, intrusive, and mishandling key issues like refugees and the economy. 65% of the British public desired the return of some EU powers to London prior to the referendum. The Brexit vote exposed a division between Scotland, which voted to remain in the EU by 62% to 38%, and the rest of the UK.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "Nicola Sturgeon stated the Scottish government would prepare legislation for a new independence referendum.", "event2_context": ["The UK voted to leave the European Union, triggering British Prime Minister David Cameron's resignation.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "Sinn Fein called for a referendum on Irish unity.", "event2_context": ["The UK voted to leave the European Union, triggering British Prime Minister David Cameron's resignation.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "Over three million Brits called for a do-over.", "event2_context": ["British voters elected to leave the European Union.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "The UK drafted the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy in 2005.", "event2_context": ["Intelligence exchanges primarily occur between individual nation states in Europe, outside of EU jurisdiction.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged. Brexit could trigger other countries to hold referendums and could lead to the break-up of the UK, with Scotland potentially leaving to stay in the EU.\n"], "event2": "The UK influenced EU initiatives, including the Europol Counter Terrorism Centre (CTC) and the PNRD.", "event2_context": ["Intelligence exchanges primarily occur between individual nation states in Europe, outside of EU jurisdiction.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations.

Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.

The UK public perceived the EU as inefficient, intrusive, and mishandling key issues like refugees and the economy. 65% of the British public desired the return of some EU powers to London prior to the referendum. The Brexit vote exposed a division between Scotland, which voted to remain in the EU by 62% to 38%, and the rest of the UK. Scotland and the rest of the UK also diverge on economic and immigration threat perceptions. Other EU member states largely viewed Brexit as detrimental to the EU.

Stanford scholar Christophe Crombez recommended the UK remain, arguing that leaving would negatively impact the UK, the EU, and global politics, and only create an illusion of sovereignty. Arguments for leaving include saving taxpayer money, avoiding unwanted EU laws, and controlling migration. Crombez refuted these, stating the UK benefits more from the EU market than its contributions, and that post-Brexit, the UK would still need to comply with EU rules to trade, and immigration requirements would still be imposed. Leaving the EU would negatively affect UK trade and GDP, create uncertainty, and consume resources in break-up negotiations. The EU would be less impacted economically, but the idea of European unification would be damaged.
