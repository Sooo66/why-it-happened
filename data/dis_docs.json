        "content": "Newly elected Polish President Karol Nawrocki is known as an EU skeptic. How can he sway Poland's EU policy, and how is he viewed in Brussels?\n\nRight-wing conservative Karol Nawrocki has won the race for the Polish presidency. During the election campaign, Nawrocki touted his affinity with US President Donald Trump and pledged a \"Poland first\" approach. He opposes Ukraine's accession to NATO and is perceived as an EU skeptic. Polish voters elected Nawrocki with the slimmest of margins on Monday morning, prompting reactions across all of Europe.\n\nMany heads of state and government congratulated the future Polish president. Among those belonging to the right-wing political spectrum were Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The latter enthused about a \"fantastic victory\" and strengthening the work of the Visegrad Group, a political alliance consisting of Poland, Hungary, The Czech Republic and Slovakia. Other heads of state and government, including Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, emphasized common values. French President Emmanuel Macron called on Poland to champion a Europe that's \"strong, independent, competitive\" and \"respects the rule of law.\"\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent congratulations as well. On X, she wrote: \"I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values.\"\n\nNawrocki ideologically close to PiS party\n\nNawrocki is officially non-partisan, but entered the campaign for presidency as a candidate backed by the right-wing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party that ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023. During its term of office, the party reformed the Polish judicial system, sparking an ongoing dispute with Brussels over accusations of dismantling the rule of law. This eventually led to a so-called Article 7 procedure. The European Union's Article 7 allows for the suspension of member state rights if that state seriously and repeatedly violates the EU core values.\n\nDespite new government, Poland remains polarized To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe procedure was closed last year when the country announced it would implement the required changes. As a result, billions of euros were disbursed to Poland, funds that had previously been frozen by the EU due to concerns about the rule of law. Many Polish government proposals were vetoed by sitting President Andrzej Duda, who also has PiS leanings. Observers expect this obstructive stance to continue under the new president. The EU Commission declined to speculate on possible repercussions. In its daily press briefing, it emphasized its confidence in Poland's further implementation of reforms and its support for the country's efforts.\n\nAre new tensions with the EU over the rule of law imminent?\n\nDaniel Freund, a member of the European Parliament, fears that Poland's political deadlock will continue. He calls on the EU commission to correct its \"mistake\" — prematurely releasing frozen EU funds — and to continue putting pressure on Poland.\n\nPiotr Buras, Warsaw bureau head of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told DW that the EU Commission would have to take into consideration what actually happened in Poland. For example, the government under Donald Tusk had seen to it that illegal laws are no longer applied, thus removing the grounds for Article 7 proceedings. Buras believes that a renewed clash with the EU over the rule of law is out of the question with the Tusk government in power.\n\nNawrocki is expected to obstruct the agenda of Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk (pictured above) Image: Frederic GARRIDO-RAMIREZ/European Union\n\nHow will the ballot impact Poland's EU policy?\n\nAccording to Buras, the newly elected president does not have the chance to exert direct influence on Poland's EU policy, because according to the Polish constitution this is solely down to the government, the political scientist said.\n\nAs commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the president of Poland appoints the government, signs international treaties, and has the power to veto laws. This is precisely how Nawrocki could interfere with the government's EU policy, said Buras. As soon as EU policy had to be implemented in national legislation, he could block it, thereby reducing the Tusk government's room for maneuver, he added. Buras expects such blockades in issues like the rule of law, abortion, migration and climate policy. He simultaneously pointed out that the Tusk government was itself far from progressive in the areas of migration and climate policy.\n\nEU Parliament torn between joy and skepticism\n\nWhereas Manfred Weber, chairman of the conservative European People's Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament, hoped that Nawrocki would work \"constructively” with Poland's government for the country's benefit, MEP Rene Repasi believed that the Polish government was caught up in a \"mess.\" For the social democrat, new parliamentary elections are not unlikely, because the right-wing conservative Nawrocki and the \"Tusk government's progressive agenda\" would get in each other's way.\n\nHowever, the right-wing conservative European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which also includes Poland's PiS party, welcomed Nawrocki's election victory. Europe must remain a \"community of free nations,\" not a \"machine\" that ignores \"the will of the people,\" said the group's co-chairman, Nicola Procaccini.\n\nPolitical scientist Buras, however, believes that Nawrocki's election victory was not tantamount to voting against the EU. Neither PiS nor Nawrocki had ever called for Poland's exit from the bloc. At the same time, Buras added that skepticism regarding a loss of sovereignty and interference in the country's internal affairs was widespread in Poland, and Nawrocki had taken advantage of that prevailing mood.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nEdited by: Jess Smee",

        "content": "Poland’s presidential election runoff will be a bitter pill for pro-European Union democrats to swallow.\n\nThe nationalist, Trumpian, historian Karol Nawrocki has narrowly defeated the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, 50.89 to 49.11%.\n\nThe Polish president has few executive powers, though the office holder is able to veto legislation. This means the consequences of a Nawrocki victory will be felt keenly, both in Poland and across Europe.\n\nWith this power, Nawrocki, backed by the conservative Law and Justice party, will no doubt stymie the ability of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Platform-led coalition to enact democratic political reforms.\n\nThis legislative gridlock could well see Law and Justice return to government in the 2027 general elections, which would lock in the anti-democratic changes the party made during their last term in office from 2015–2023. This included eroding Poland’s judicial independence by effectively taking control of judicial appointments and the supreme court.\n\nNawrocki’s win has given pro-Donald Trump, anti-liberal, anti-EU forces across the continent a shot in the arm. It’s bad news for the EU, Ukraine and women.\n\nA rising Poland\n\nFor much of the post-second world war era, Poland has had limited European influence.\n\nThis is no longer the case. Poland’s economy has boomed since it joined the EU in 2004. It spends almost 5% of its gross domestic product on defence, almost double what it spent in 2022 at the time of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPoland now has a bigger army than the United Kingdom, France and Germany. And living standards, adjusted for purchasing power, are about to eclipse Japan’s.\n\nAlong with Brexit, these changes have resulted in the EU’s centre of gravity shifting eastwards towards Poland. As a rising military and economic power of 37 million people, what happens in Poland will help shape Europe’s future.\n\nImpacts on Ukraine\n\nPoland’s new position in Europe is most clearly demonstrated by its central role in the fight to defend Ukraine against Russia.\n\nThis centrality was clearly demonstrated during the recent “Coalition of the Willing” summit in Kyiv, where Tusk joined the leaders of Europe’s major powers – France, Germany and the UK – to bolster support for Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHowever, Poland’s unqualified support for Ukraine will now be at risk because Nawrocki has demonised Ukrainian refugees in his country and opposed Ukrainian integration into European-oriented bodies, such as the EU and NATO.\n\nNawrocki was also backed during his campaign by the Trump administration. Kristi Noem, the US secretary of homeland security, said at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in Poland:\n\nDonald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country.\n\nTrump also hosted Nawrocki in the Oval Office when he was merely a candidate for office. This was a significant deviation from standard US diplomatic protocol to stay out of foreign elections.\n\nNawrocki has not been as pro-Russia as some other global, MAGA-style politicians, but this is largely due to Poland’s geography and its difficult history with Russia. It has been repeatedly invaded across its eastern plains by Russian or Soviet troops. And along with Ukraine, Poland shares borders with the Russian client state of Belarus and Russia itself in Kaliningrad, the heavily militarised enclave on the Baltic Sea.\n\nI experienced the proximity of these borders during fieldwork in Poland in 2023 when I travelled by car from Warsaw to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, via the Suwalki Gap.\n\nThis is the strategically important, 100-kilometre-long border between Poland and Lithuania, which connects the Baltic states to the rest of NATO and the EU to the south. It’s seen as a potential flashpoint if Russia were ever to close the gap and isolate the Baltic states.\n\nPoland’s conservative nationalist politicians are therefore less Russia-friendly than those in Hungary or Slovakia. Nawrocki, for instance, does not support cutting off weapons to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, a Nawrocki presidency will still be more hostile to Ukraine and its interests. During the campaign, Nawrocki said Zelensky “treats Poland badly”, echoing the type of language used by Trump himself.\n\nJarek Praszkiewicz/PAP/EPA\n\nPoland divided\n\nThe high stakes in the election resulted in a record turnout of almost 73%.\n\nThere was a stark choice in the election between Nawrocki and Trzaskowski.\n\nTrzaskowski supported the liberalisation of Poland’s harsh abortion laws – abortion was effectively banned in Poland under the Law and Justice government – and the introduction of civil partnerships for LGBTQ+ couples.\n\nAndrzej Jackowski/PAP/EPA\n\nNawrocki opposed these changes and will likely veto any attempt to implement them.\n\nWhile the polls for the presidential runoff election had consistently shown a tight race, an Ipsos exit poll published during the vote count demonstrated the social divisions now facing the country.\n\nAs in other recent global elections, women and those with higher formal education voted for the progressive candidate (Trzaskowski), while men and those with less formal education voted for the conservative (Nawrocki).\n\nAfter the surprise success of the liberal, pro-EU presidential candidate in the Romanian elections a fortnight ago, pro-EU forces were hoping for a similar result in Poland, as well.\n\nThat, for now, is a pipe dream and liberals across the continent will now need to negotiate a difficult relationship with a right-wing, Trumpian leader in the new beating heart of Europe.",

        "content": "The polls have spoken. Karol Nawrocki, a historian and former boxer backed by Poland’s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, narrowly triumphed over Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski in Sunday’s presidential election. Nawrocki, whose candidacy was embraced by the Trump administration, will be the head of state opposite the centrist, pro-European head of government, Prime Minister Donald Tusk. With war still raging in next-door Ukraine and US-European relations under strain, what should the world expect from Nawrocki? We turned to our Poland experts for answers.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nDaniel Fried: Nawrocki is well placed to encourage Trump to back Ukraine and European security\n\nAaron Korewa: Poland’s conservative nationalism is pro-American and pro-NATO\n\nMarek Magierowski: Nawrocki’s politics defy hysterical labels\n\nDanuta Hübner: Will the new president overcome Poland’s polarization?\n\nMark Scott: Social media was rampant in this election. But how much impact it had is unclear.\n\nNawrocki is well placed to encourage Trump to back Ukraine and European security\n\nSome initial analysis may depict the Polish presidential election as a fight between democracy and autocracy, or between a pro-Trump and pro-European candidate. This seems exaggerated. The real challenge for Nawrocki will be deciding whether to find common ground with the Tusk government in the face of the threat from Russia and the need to work with the Trump administration on behalf of European and Ukrainian security.\n\nThere are substantive grounds for at least some cooperation across partisan lines in Poland to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression and, to this end, to work with key European allies, such as Britain, France, and Germany, as well as with the United States. Unlike the Hungarian nationalist leader Viktor Orbán, Polish nationalists and outgoing President Andrzej Duda generally support Ukraine and resolutely oppose Russian aggression. In early 2022, for example, PiS party leader Jarosław Kaczyński publicly broke with Orbán over the latter’s lack of support for Ukraine at the time. Poland’s current rapid military buildup began during the previous PiS government and continued under the Tusk coalition. Both political camps support NATO and strong relations with the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration backed Nawrocki during the election campaign. However unwise US official partisanship during an election might have been, this will give Nawrocki advantages as a perceived ideological ally making the case in Washington for continued US military presence in Poland and US support for NATO and Ukraine. Nawrocki may face challenges working with the European Union (EU), which is still a source of significant funding for Polish development and is trying to support military buildup in Europe, an objective Poles across the political spectrum tend to support. He will also have to contain the anti-German rhetoric common to much of the Polish nationalist right. Poland has had legitimate complaints about German policy toward Russia. But it has won those arguments, as many Germans themselves recognize; Nawrocki would do well to take the win and work with Germany to counter the Russian threat both countries face.\n\nMany Poles were supportive of Ukraine in the initial phases of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, providing extensive benefits to Ukrainian refugees and taking hundreds of thousands of them into their homes. While the presence of so many Ukrainian refugees has grown less popular over time, Polish support for Ukraine has remained steady. Still, influential Polish constituencies, such as farmers and some groups concerned with the difficult historical issues between Poles and Ukrainians, have been skeptical about the extent of Polish support for Ukraine. During the campaign, Nawrocki declared that he does not currently support Ukraine’s NATO accession. Now, Nawrocki will have to find a way to balance strategic and political imperatives on support for Ukraine.\n\nAs president, Nawrocki will have to balance his campaign rhetoric and partisan interests with broader national interests. He’s hardly the first winning candidate to have to do so.\n\n—Daniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former US ambassador to Poland.\n\nPoland’s conservative nationalism is pro-American and pro-NATO\n\nThe Poles showed their dissatisfaction with the current government and the political establishment. Nawrocki was an outsider and that paid off. He managed to attract the voters who chose far-right candidates in the first round, while Trzaskowski did not manage to mobilize enough of the voters who supported Tusk’s coalition in October 2023.\n\nFor Europe, this could mean that Poland will become more inwardly focused. At the same time, Tusk has previously signaled that he believes beating populism requires addressing some of the issues that drive it. Expect Poland to take a turn for the right on matters such as migration and the European Green Deal.\n\nNawrocki was the only candidate who visited US President Donald Trump in the White House and received his endorsement. In late May, the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC, also held a rally in the southeastern town of Rzeszów that featured US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Nawrocki’s people made conscious outreach to the US administration. In Poland, the movement that backs Nawrocki is very pro-American and pro-NATO, unlike several other parties in Europe that stand for conservative nationalism. The optimistic scenario is that as president, Nawrocki will establish a connection with Trump that will prevent any plans to withdraw US troops from Poland. At the same time, Tusk’s government will continue forging partnerships with other relevant European states, such as France and the Nordic and Baltic countries.\n\n—Aaron Korewa is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Warsaw Office which is part of the Europe Center.\n\nNawrocki’s politics defy hysterical labels\n\nFirst and foremost, branding Nawrocki as “populist,” “hard-core Euroskeptic,” “far right,” “pro-Putin,” or “Trumpian” is preposterous. Polish politics is too complex to indulge in such simplistic terms.\n\nPoland’s president-elect is probably as “pro-Kremlin” as his entire political camp, which, while in power, provided Ukraine with hundreds of tanks, aircraft, howitzers, and communication gear, while pressuring all European partners to ramp up sanctions against Russia.\n\nNawrocki is also as “Euroskeptic” as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, given the attitude of both politicians toward migration policies and EU climate regulations. And he is as “Trumpian” as his Finnish soon-to-be counterpart Alexander Stubb, who charmingly played a spot of golf with the US president a few weeks ago.\n\nNawrocki is doubtless a staunch conservative who adroitly capitalized on the nature of wide swaths of the Polish electorate, which, contrary to European trends, has remained—politically, socially, and emotionally—attached to the notion of freedom, sovereignty, tradition, and Christian values. The PiS-backed candidate has also largely banked on the rising unpopularity of Tusk’s government, especially among young voters (Nawrocki won the eighteen-to-twenty-nine-year-old cohort).\n\nAnother major factor in Nawrocki’s win was the aristocratic style and aloofness of his rival, Trzaskowski, who was unable to connect with the working class and Poland’s rural constituency. This stood in contrast to Nawrocki, the former boxer and son of a toolmaker and a bookbinder.\n\n—Marek Magierowski is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center and the director of strategy for the Poland program at the Freedom Institute in Warsaw. He previously served as Poland’s ambassador to the United States and to Israel.\n\nWill the new president overcome Poland’s polarization?\n\nPoles know that their vote can change the course of the history of their country. And they have known from day one of this presidential campaign that this election matters deeply for our future. However, as, sadly, the campaign was about preventing the other side from coming to power, it is an open question whether the president we have just elected will understand what is good for Poles in these times of uncertainty.\n\nWill our new president spare no effort to overcome the deep polarization of the Polish people? A polarized society is easy to manipulate and an easy target for Russian disinformation. This is the biggest challenge for the new president—understanding the importance of building bridges between Poles. It is an extremely difficult task, especially in times when many political careers have been built for decades on societal divisions. And I worry that this president-elect comes from a political tradition with little propensity to seek compromise. The presidency is an important part of the Polish system of checks and balances, and the new president will need to support the government in building a democratic Poland where everyone can live.\n\nPoles need a president who will understand that isolation has never done Poland any good, that the European Union is our place, and that it is crucial that Poland takes its share of responsibility for Europe. Will the new president support European efforts to build its defense capabilities and its security-based economic competitiveness? Will he work for peace on our continent?\n\nIn addition, my hope is that the new president will work to keep the United States and Europe together. They need each other.\n\n—Danuta Hübner is a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center. She was Poland’s first-ever European commissioner, responsible first for trade, then with regional policy. She also established and oversaw the institutional structure to deliver Poland’s accession to the EU.\n\nSocial media was rampant in this election. But what impact did it have?\n\nThe narrow victory for Nawrocki in Poland’s presidential election is the latest example of why it’s hard to directly link any country’s electoral outcome with how voters engage with candidates, political operatives, and others across social media. There was a significant amount of hyper-partisan attacks across social media, from both sides, ahead of Sunday’s vote in the Central European country. There was also evidence—including via research from the Atlantic Council—that foreign governments attempted to sway voter outcomes.\n\nBut how successful these efforts were, as well as the ongoing interventions from social media companies to possibly reduce such content’s impact, are almost impossible to quantify. Given the tightly run race, small shifts in voters’ behavior—potentially spurred on by what people may have seen in their online feeds—could have played a role. But, at this stage, that is more a theory than confirmed reality.\n\nThe most recent Polish presidential election joins a growing list of both European and non-European elections in which social media and its impact on how people voted remain a black box. As much as EU policymakers have centered their attention on how the likes of TikTok and YouTube may have amplified anti-EU voices ahead of national elections, there has been a growing offline shift in public opinion across the bloc away from greater EU alignment that has nothing to do with the digital world.\n\nAt best, this weekend’s vote is another example of how, in the middle of 2025, these digital platforms are now part of every country’s election cycle. But social media’s impact on such a closely fought election is mostly unknown.\n\n—Mark Scott is a senior resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab’s (DFRLab) Democracy + Tech Initiative within the Atlantic Council Technology Programs.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: Daniel Fried, Aaron Korewa, Marek Magierowski, Danuta Hübner, and Mark Scott\n\nImage: Law and Justice party supported candidate for the President of Poland Karol Nawrocki during the election evening after the seond round of presidential election in Warsaw, Poland on June 1, 2025.

He believes that good relations with Brussels, Berlin, and Paris are against Polish interests, and he opposes NATO or European Union membership for Ukraine as long as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. Given that Russia’s initial invasion started in 2014, this does not bode well for Ukraine’s future.\n\nThe global security environment and the continent’s struggles mean that the stakes are high. The EU is wrestling with economic sluggishness and a lack of competitiveness, as well as how to respond adequately to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. The bloc is also divided over how to deal with China during a second Trump term. Various EU countries have unsustainable levels of public debt. This has implications for further borrowing for much-needed joint defense procurement and repayment of NextGenerationEU loans—the European Commission’s economic recovery loans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, climate change is accelerating and has recently devastated communities in Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe increased support for far-right populism adds an additional layer of complexity. Populism’s simplified response to complex challenges may appeal to voters who have faced crisis after crisis with COVID-19 lockdowns, increased energy prices, and high levels of inflation, but it rarely solves the issues. And yet centrist politicians continue to fail to present a viable alternative.\n\nSimply hoping that centrists will do well in an election is kicking the can down the road. It was never a deliberate strategy, of course. But in today’s climate, the absence of a viable plan is dangerous. In Germany, for example, the dangerous moment was not the federal elections held in February. The real danger is what will happen in the next federal elections—due to be held by March 2029—and all the policy decisions made between now and then.\n\nIf centrists are serious about keeping the far right out of power, then they need to get much better at actually addressing voters’ concerns. The key issues will differ by country, of course, but there are shared themes across Europe: the cost of living, the economy, and the security situation tend to be among top voter concerns.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for centrist politicians is to make the case for potentially unpopular policies—a difficult thing to do in an increasingly polarized environment. Yet achieving the energy transition and increasing spending for defense are not optional. The real question, then, is how to gain support for policies that may hurt voters’ personal finances. This has to involve a public debate about the trade-offs.\n\nCurrently, centrist politicians Europe-wide do the exact opposite. Rather than make the case for ambitious policies, they cherry-pick far-right policy positions in an attempt to tempt voters away from the extremes. Lessons from elections in the United Kingdom—and also Poland—show that this creates more momentum for the far right while centrist parties lose their traditional bases to parties that are further left.\n\nThis is how Reform U.K. was galvanized in recent local elections in Britain, and how the far-right Alternative for Germany surged in Germany’s election. It is also an important reminder as the Netherlands likely heads towards a new snap election. (Dutch media is reporting that following the defection of far-right leader Geert Wilders from the ruling coalition, new elections could be held in the fall.) After the conservative-liberal Party for Freedom and Democracy tried to adopt a hard-line anti-immigration rhetoric in the run-up to the last parliamentary election in 2023, it lost voters to far-right Wilders’s Freedom Party.\n\nBeyond specific policy issues, the future of liberal democracy is increasingly being determined at the ballot box. The recent elections in Poland and Romania have presented voters with a stark choice: a vote for rules-based liberalism or a possible descent into MAGA-like quasi-authoritarianism. This has mobilized voters. In both instances, turnout was record high or close to it.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interference—U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem made the trans-Atlantic journey to Poland a few days before the second round to stump for Nawrocki—may have had an impact too. While most Polish diaspora voters voted for Trzaskowski, Poles in the United States voted overwhelmingly for Nawrocki.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, voters are demanding change from their governments, which are seen by many as corrupt and stuck. In Hungary, former Fidesz insider Peter Magyar’s support keeps increasing in polls ahead of the parliamentary election that is scheduled for spring 2026. Magyar is running on a platform to address corruption at a time when inflation remains high and voters feel worse off economically.\n\nIn Serbia, protests have been ongoing for months: What started as a student-led movement demanding answers regarding a collapsed train station canopy roof that killed 16 people has turned into a nationwide anti-corruption and rule of law movement against populist nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic’s government; the head of his prime minister has already rolled.\n\nIn Slovakia, thousands have protested a so-called foreign agents law, which opponents say is copied straight from the Kremlin and makes it harder for nongovernmental organizations and civil society to operate in the country.\n\nWhat this suggests is that ultimately, across the spectrum, voters want accountability. There will always be an election somewhere, but currently, too many pressing policy issues hinge on an election going “the right way.” Centrists need to get active and come up with a better plan.",

        "content": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe.\n\nNawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country’s domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.\n\nHere are some key takeaways:\n\nConservative populism on the rise\n\nNawrocki’s victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions.\n\nThe 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland’s sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.\n\nHis win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right — even the far right in recent times.\n\nFar-right candidates did very well in Poland’s first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.\n\nAs his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.\n\n“Poland remains a deeply divided country,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, the president of the Polish Institute of Public Affairs.\n\n“Although the electoral turnout was highest ever in history of presidential elections, Mr. Nawrocki’s margin of victory is very small, which means that half of Poland will be cheering his presidency, whereas half of Poland, the other half, remains deeply worried or even disturbed,” he added.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk’s troubles\n\nNawrocki’s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.\n\nBut Tusk’s coalition — a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives — has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.\n\nNawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk’s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.\n\nTies with the Trump administration\n\nNawrocki’s election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.\n\nPoland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.\n\nTrump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.\n\nA shifting focus on Ukraine\n\nWhile Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid — particularly support for refugees.\n\nHis rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland’s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki’s approach could shift Poland’s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.\n\nTies with the EU\n\nThe election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk’s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.\n\n“This is very bad news for the European Union as well as Poland’s key European partners, both Germany and France as well as Ukraine,” said Kucharczyk, the analyst.\n\n“Mr. Nawrocki is well known for his Eurosceptic stand. He’s opposed to deepening European integration and European cooperation. He is also opposed to Ukraine’s NATO membership,” he added.\n\nNawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland’s national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.\n\nWhile the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki’s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels’ efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.\n\nMarket jitters\n\nThough an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.\n\nBillions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk’s government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.\n\n___\n\nAP’s video journalist Rafal Niedzielski in Warsaw, Poland, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Media Contact 202-226-8467\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast led fellow members of the panel in a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raising serious concerns over the European Union’s role in ensuring fair elections as Poland approaches the second round of its presidential elections on June 1, 2025.\n\nChairman Mast and his fellow Republicans cite recent reports that a Polish NGO with ties to U.S. Democrat Party megadonor George Soros facilitated a social media campaign featuring $105,000 worth of allegedly illegal political ads promoting Civic Coalition candidate Rafal Trzaskowski and discrediting his rivals.\n\nThe new developments follow a monthslong refusal by Poland’s current government to release tens of millions of dollars in public campaign funds to the opposition Law and Justice party.\n\n“Reports of foreign-funded political advertisements favoring Rafał Trzaskowski, the Civic Coalition (KO) candidate backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, that may have occurred in contravention of Polish law, combined with the Tusk government’s reported monthslong refusal to comply with court orders to release public funding to the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, suggest a deliberate effort to tilt the electoral playing field,” the lawmakers wrote. “These actions, occurring under the European Commission’s watch, expose a troubling double-standard in the EU’s approach to Poland’s rule of law, which demands your urgent attention.”\n\nIn addition to Chairman Mast, the letter was co-signed by Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Keith Self (R-TX), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Warren Davidson (R-OH), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), and Andy Harris (R-MD).\n\nRead the full letter here and below.\n\nDear President von der Leyen:\n\nWe write to express profound alarm over reported developments in Poland that may undermine the integrity of its democratic processes, particularly as the country approaches the second round of its presidential election on June 1, 2025. Reports of foreign-funded political advertisements favoring Rafał Trzaskowski, the Civic Coalition (KO) candidate backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, that may have occurred in contravention of Polish law, combined with the Tusk government’s reported monthslong refusal to comply with court orders to release public funding to the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, suggest a deliberate effort to tilt the electoral playing field. These actions, occurring under the European Commission’s watch, expose a troubling double-standard in the EU’s approach to Poland’s rule of law, which demands your urgent attention.\n\nOn May 15, an investigation by a leading Polish publication reported that a Polish NGO, which received funding from organizations funded by U.S. Democratic Party megadonor George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, facilitated the production of social media advertisements promoting Trzaskowski and discrediting his rivals, PiS-backed Karol Nawrocki and Confederation-backed Sławomir Mentzen. Several sources also reported that Estratos Digital GmbH—a Vienna-based firm majority-owned by Higher Ground Labs, a U.S. fund operated by major Democratic Party operatives who helped run the U.S. presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris—was behind the approximately 420,000 PLN ($105,000 USD) in allegedly “illegal political ads” posted by the Polish NGO on Facebook since April 10, 2025 in support of Trzaskowski. Estratos is the same organization that reportedly played a key role backing the anti-Viktor Orban opposition in Hungary’s 2022 elections, allegedly “concealing campaign financing sources, raising additional red flags about their operations in Poland.”\n\nEqually disturbing are reports of the Tusk government’s monthslong refusal to release tens of millions of dollars in public campaign funding that PiS is legally entitled to receive, defying a ruling by the Supervisory Chamber of Poland’s Supreme Court, a payment demand from Poland’s National Electoral Commission, and an opinion by Poland’s Ombudsman (Human Rights Commissioner) Marcin Wiące to release the money. Further, by withholding these funds, the Tusk administration appears to be attempting to cripple PiS’s ability to compete fairly in the presidential election and violating the rule of law.\n\nThe European Union, as a guarantor of democratic standards and human rights under the Treaty on European Union, has a responsibility to ensure that member states uphold the rule of law. Yet, despite the European Commission’s vocal criticism and decision to withhold over $150 billion from Poland for alleged rule of law violations under the previous PiS government, it has remained conspicuously silent despite clear evidence of rule of law violations under Tusk’s administration. In fact, in February 2024—after the Tusk government ousted and installed a new National Prosecutor without President Duda’s approval in reported violation of Polish law—the European Commission, under your direction, released $7.1 billion (€6.3 billion) of the funds it had been withholding from the PiS government despite the fact that the Tusk government had not yet implemented any of the “milestones” the EU had demanded the previous PiS government complete for their release. This selective enforcement—condemning and sanctioning PiS while ignoring Tusk’s actions—suggests a double standard that could undermine the EU’s credibility as a guardian of democratic principles.\n\nThese developments also raise critical questions about the integrity of Poland’s democratic institutions and the EU’s role in ensuring fair elections. To address these concerns, we respectfully request that your staff arrange a briefing to answer the following questions:\n\n1.

Many of its legislative efforts had been blocked by PiS-aligned incumbent President Andrzej Duda and that is likely to continue under Nawrocki.\n\nIn his speech immediately after the polls closed, when the result was still in doubt, Nawrocki said: “We will save Poland, we will not allow the power of Donald Tusk to be complete.”\n\n“Nawrocki’s presidency means a high-level conflict between the president and Tusk,” said Joanna Sawicka, a political analyst with Polityka Insight, a Warsaw-based think tank. “But it’s clear that it will be difficult for the government to implement key reforms because the president can veto most of them.”\n\nThe Polish presidency is a largely ceremonial function, and the government is in charge of foreign policy, but the president can veto legislation or send it off for judicial review. The Tusk-led coalition doesn’t have the votes in parliament to override that, so a President Nawrocki will make it very difficult for the prime minister to govern.\n\n“The opposition camp, now led by Nawrocki, may also strive for early parliamentary elections, although it is not clear if this strategy could succeed. If not, a change in power is likely in 2027 anyway,” Sawicka added.",

        "content": "Aleks Szczerbiak analyses the results of the recent Polish presidential election which saw right-wing candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly beat centrist Rafał Trzaskowski with 50.89 percent and 49.11 percent of the vote respectively. He argues Karol Nawrocki’s election will have significant implications on the ability of the ruling coalition to govern effectively until its term ends in 2027.\n\nAlthough the Polish President is not involved in day-to-day governance and has no formal foreign policy competencies, Mr Nawrocki’s victory will de-stabilise the government, severely complicate its institutional reform and legislative agenda, and limit its room for manoeuvre on the international stage, especially when it comes to relations with the EU.\n\nHistorian Karol Nawrocki – supported by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) grouping, won a narrow victory in the country’s presidential election. He defeated Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski – candidate of the liberal-centrist Civic Platform (PO), currently the main governing party led by prime minister Donald Tusk – by a margin of 50.9% to 49.1%.\n\nThe narrowness of Mr Nawrocki’s victory on a record 71.6% turnout, reflects deep divisions within Polish society. Mr Nawrocki’s voters, generally based in smaller towns and rural areas, tend to be less well-off, less well-educated, more culturally conservative, Eurosceptic, and often deeply suspicious of the elites and institutions that have emerged in Poland since the collapse of communism.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s victory will have huge implications for the ability of the ruling coalition to govern effectively during the remainder of its term, which runs until autumn 2027. Since it took office in December 2023, Mr Tusk’s government has had to ‘cohabit’ with Law and Justice-aligned President Andrzej Duda and lacks the three-fifths parliamentary majority required to over-turn a presidential legislative veto.\n\nThe President can also delay legislation by referring it to the constitutional tribunal, a powerful body which rules on the constitutionality of Polish laws. All its members were appointed by previous Law and Justice-dominated parliaments. The Tusk government does not recognise the tribunal’s legitimacy and is refusing to implement its rulings, but if the presidential referral is made under the so-called ‘preventative control’ mode, legislation only comes into effect after the tribunal’s ruling, providing it with a de facto veto.\n\nThis will continue to function as a major obstacle to the Tusk government’s efforts to unravel its predecessor’s legacy, particularly attempts to roll back judicial reforms. Around 2,500 judges appointed by Mr Duda, including the majority of the country’s supreme court, were nominated by the national judicial council (KRS), which was overhauled by Law and Justice in 2018. Most of its members are now chosen by elected bodies such as parliament rather than the legal profession, as was the case previously.\n\nThe Tusk government does not recognise these appointments, referring to them disparagingly as ‘neo-judges’, but, like Mr Duda, Mr Nawrocki will block any reforms that he feels undermine their legitimacy. The European Commission had stipulated that the introduction of legislative changes to unravel Law and Justice’s judicial reforms were a strict condition for unblocking Poland’s access to EU coronavirus recovery funds. Brussels unfroze these funds when Mr Tusk returned to office on the basis of an action plan rather than actual changes to the legal system. Mr Nawrocki’s election means that such legislation is very unlikely to be approved leaving Brussels vulnerable to charges of continuing to apply double standards if still allows the Tusk government access to these funds.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s huge electoral mandate, in a contest framed as a referendum on the Tusk government, will also create political momentum that Law and Justice hopes will carry it through to victory in the next parliamentary poll. However, an early election is unlikely. Dissolving parliament is virtually impossible without the consent of the governing parties , and all of them want to maintain their access to state appointments and patronage for as long as possible. The Tusk administration will be increasingly weak and divided but is likely to hold together.\n\nPolish foreign policy is determined by the government, so Mr Nawrocki’s impact here is likely to be limited and largely symbolic. But symbolism matters in international politics, and the President does have some foreign affairs-related competencies. Most importantly, he is commander-in-chief of the armed forces so can influence security policy debates. Ambassadorial appointments also must be approved by the President. Poland does not currently have a full Ambassador to Washington because Mr Duda refused to accept the government’s nominee.\n\nMr Nawrocki supports continued Polish EU membership but is an anti-federalist and argues that Poland’s interests often clash with the major European powers, especially Germany, with whom Mr Tusk has been trying to build closer ties. Due to public hostility, the Tusk government has had to put support for deeper European integration in areas such as migration and climate policy on the back-burner. Mr Nawrocki’s victory could further limit its room for manoeuvre on these issues if, for example, he proposes legislation rejecting the EU’s Green Deal.\n\nMr Nawrocki will also prioritise maintaining close ties with the USA, which he argues is Poland’s only credible security guarantor, and oppose the development of a European defence capability outside of NATO structures. The Trump administration openly supported Mr Nawrocki, including a headline-grabbing Oval Office meeting with US President himself.\n\nMr Nawrocki’s critics argue that, by expressing scepticism about Ukrainian NATO accession, he is legitimising the Russian war narrative. In fact, Mr Nawrocki supports the broad consensus within Poland on the need to continue providing diplomatic and military aid to Ukraine; Moscow has even issued an arrest warrant against him. However, Mr Nawrocki has criticised Ukraine’s lack of co-operation with exhumations of the remains of Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War, and pledged to protect Polish farmers from what he argues is unfair competition from Ukrainian agricultural goods. He clearly favours a more transactional approach to relations with Ukraine and feels that Poland needs to be more assertive in promoting its interests when these clash with its Eastern neighbours.\n\nThe Polish President is a largely ceremonial figure not involved in the day-to-day governance of the country in either domestic or foreign policy. But his ability to block legislation, together with the political authority that comes from a huge electoral mandate and political dynamics that this can unleash, mean that Mr Nawrocki’s election will be extremely significant in terms of shaping how Poland is governed in the coming years.\n\nBy Professor Aleks Szczerbiak, Professor of Politics & Head of Department, University of Sussex",

        "content": "Presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party, second right, greets supporters at his headquarters after the presidential election runoff in Warsaw, Poland, Sunday, June 1, 2025.\n\nNationalist historian Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election, official results showed on Monday, in a major blow for the country's pro-EU government.\n\nThe 42-year-old, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, scored 50.9 percent of the vote in Sunday's runoff.\n\nHis 53-year-old rival Rafal Trzaskowski, Warsaw's pro-EU mayor and an ally of the country's centrist government, won 49.1 percent in the highly polarised NATO and EU nation.\n\nNawrocki's win will block the government's progressive agenda for abortion and LGBTQ rights and could revive tensions with Brussels over rule-of-law issues.\n\nHis victory could also undermine strong ties with neighbouring Ukraine, as he is critical of Kyiv's EU and NATO accession plans and wants to cut benefits for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nPopulist backlash in central Europe To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

Try again 12:27 TALKING EUROPE © FRANCE 24\n\nPolish presidents have some influence over foreign and defence policy and wield veto power over legislation, which can only be overturned by a three-fifths majority in parliament – which Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government does not have.\n\nReforms planned by Tusk, a former European Council president who came to power in 2023, have been held up by a deadlock with the current president – who endorsed Nawrocki.\n\nMany Nawrocki supporters say they want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate conservative social values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki, saying she was \"confident\" that \"very good cooperation\" would continue with Warsaw.\n\nNATO chief Mark Rutte also sent congratulations.\n\nNawrocki promised a 'strong' Poland. © Sergei Gapon, AFP\n\nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban hailed his fellow nationalist's \"fantastic victory\", writing on X: \"We are looking forward to working with you.\"\n\nTo display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement. Accept Manage my choices\n\nFrench far-right leader Marine Le Pen also welcomed the \"good news\".\n\nNawrocki visited the White House during his campaign and said he had been told by Trump: \"You will win.\"\n\nUS Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also endorsed Nawrocki in Poland last week, saying: \"He needs to be the next president.\"\n\n'Patriot'\n\nNawrocki thanked his backers for their \"daily support\" in a Facebook post on Monday.\n\nTrzaskowski has yet to publicly react to the official results.\n\nOutgoing President Andrzej Duda, a conservative who has served the two-term limit, congratulated Nawrocki and thanked Poles for the turnout, which was 72 percent.\n\nPolish far-right leader Slawomir Mentzen also sent his congratulations, telling Nawrocki his Confederation party's voters expected him to \"not put Ukraine's interests on par with ours\".\n\nThe results followed a tense evening, as both candidates had claimed victory when an exit poll indicated they were neck and neck.\n\nTrzaskowski narrowly finished second © Sergei Gapon, AFP\n\n\"We will win and we will save Poland,\" Nawrocki told supporters after voting finished.\n\nNawrocki's victory is likely to embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023.\n\nSome analysts have predicted it could lead to fresh parliamentary elections if political deadlock with the government persists.\n\n\"I'm glad Nawrocki won... It was a really close race, but I think it'll all be good, things will get better,\" 58-year-old security guard Waldemar told AFP in Warsaw.\n\nAccountant and history buff Anna Maria Ziolkiewicz said \"the brightest Poland\" won.\n\nThe 61-year-old religious conservative from Lodz, central Poland told AFP she voted for Nawrocki \"because he is a patriot\".\n\n'They'll block everything'\n\nBut Trzaskowski voter Zdzislaw Brojek said he expected \"chaos\" under the new president, who he claimed would do the PiS party's bidding.\n\n\"They will block laws, they'll block everything,\" the 65-year-old gardener told AFP in Warsaw.\n\nTrzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.\n\nNawrocki's campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over a murky apartment purchase and his football hooligan past.\n\nNawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.\n\n\"It was a genocide against the Polish people,\" he said.\n\nPoland is a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine.\n\nIt is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)",

        "content": "A new peer-reviewed study from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London Hospitals has found that quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccines (QIVs)—the standard annual flu shots—do not generate protective antibodies against two dangerous strains of avian influenza A(H5N1), including the version recently detected in U.S. dairy cattle and linked to human infections.\n\nPublished in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the study analyzed blood samples from 61 adults who received flu vaccines across the 2021–2024 seasons. While the vaccines effectively boosted immunity against seasonal flu viruses, they failed to trigger any meaningful immune response against the two H5N1 strains tested.\n\nNo Protection Against H5N1\n\nDespite strong responses to the seasonal H1N1 flu virus, none of the participants showed antibody responses that would help neutralize the tested H5N1 viruses—one from a 2023 outbreak in Cambodia, and one from a 2024 U.S. dairy cow linked to recent human infections. This indicates that current flu shots are unlikely to protect people from serious illness if H5N1 spreads more widely among humans.\n\nRising Risk of Human Transmission\n\nThe findings come amid growing concern that H5N1 is evolving in animals, particularly on dairy farms where the virus has been detected in cows, cats, rodents—and in some human cases. U.S. officials have also found traces of the virus in wastewater and in raw milk. While pasteurized milk remains safe, the presence of live virus in unpasteurized products adds another route of possible exposure.\n\nSome human infections so far have been mild, but the virus’s continued spread in mammals raises the risk it could adapt to spread more easily between people. If that happens, current flu vaccines won’t be enough to protect vulnerable populations.\n\nVulnerable Groups May Be at Greater Risk\n\nThe study focused on healthy adults, the group most likely to mount a strong immune response to vaccines. The lack of H5N1 protection even in this group is especially concerning, as older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and others at higher risk for severe illness would likely fare even worse if exposed to this virus.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThis research is a warning signal. Public health efforts cannot rely on seasonal flu vaccines to prevent serious illness from H5N1 if it starts spreading more widely among humans. With limited global supplies of vaccines designed specifically for H5N1, the study reinforces the need for faster development and broader access to targeted vaccines.\n\nThe authors call for:\n\nAccelerated development of H5N1-specific vaccines\n\nImproved surveillance in animals and humans\n\nFocused protection for high-risk groups\n\nAs H5N1 continues to spread in animals and cause sporadic human infections, this study underscores the urgent need to prepare for the possibility of broader transmission. Seasonal flu vaccines remain an important tool—but they won’t protect against this virus. Moving forward, pandemic preparedness will depend on the rapid development of H5-specific vaccines, improved detection systems, and targeted strategies to protect those most at risk.\n\n\n\nStevenson-Leggett P, Adams L, Greenwood D, et al.

        "content": "Trump administration cancels plans to develop a bird flu vaccine\n\ntoggle caption thianchai sitthikongsak/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nThe federal government announced Wednesday that it is canceling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's been spreading among dairy cows in the U.S., citing concerns about the safety of the mRNA technology being used.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including the H5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.\n\n\"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said.\n\nHe added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\"\n\n\"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\"\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\"\n\nThe administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.\n\n\"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.\n\n\"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed.\n\n\"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 1,072 dairy herds, more than 173 million poultry, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.",

        "content": "Vaccines Respiratory viruses Federal agencies See all topics Follow\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services is terminating a contract with drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect against bird flu amid the agency’s broader efforts to reevaluate therapies that use mRNA technology.\n\nThe contract, which was worth $590 million, was announced in mid-January, just before President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nModerna said Wednesday that an early-phase trial of its mRNA-based vaccine against H5 bird flu in about 300 healthy adults showed “a rapid, potent and durable immune response.”\n\n“While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile … and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement. ”These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.”\n\nHowever, HHS said Wednesday that the project doesn’t meet scientific or safety expectations for continued investment.\n\n“After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna’s H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,” HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement. “The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been looking to evaluate mRNA research and technology and ensure transparency, an administration official told CNN last month.\n\nMRNA technology is already used in Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s currently licensed Covid-19 vaccines, which have been found to be safe and effective. But public health experts have expressed concern that increasing anti-vaccine sentiments in general – and anti-mRNA sentiments specifically – may block people from accessing vaccines.\n\n“The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, said Wednesday on social media. “It was President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. These vaccines have been administered nearly 2 billion times to hundreds of millions of people around the world – making it one of the most widely used and widely studied vaccines in human history. They are safe and work well.\n\n“If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk.”\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a broad term that refers to several types of influenza that normally infect birds. The H5N1 virus has raised concern among health officials because it has sickened dozens of people in the United States and killed one.\n\nThe US does have vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, but they are made with older technology.\n\nIn February, Bloomberg News reported that US health officials were reevaluating the Moderna contract.\n\n“I’m very disappointed, candidly,” Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a physician and retired Air Force major general who was director of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in the Biden administration, told CNN in March. “One of the real challenges when a new pathogen emerges is that it takes time to produce therapeutics, and it takes time to produce vaccines.\n\n“So we worked very closely with industry to try and find ways to fund research and clinical trials and make sure that we had a variety of options available if this virus became more dangerous,” he said. “Because we just don’t know what’s going to happen next with this virus.”\n\nCNN’s Deidre McPhillips, Brenda Goodman and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "content": "“We shouldn’t let politically motivated attempts to unfairly brand mRNA vaccines as dangerous stand in the way of ensuring everyone who wants a pandemic vaccine can get one,” she said.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s ideas for containing bird flu are unorthodox. He has suggested that instead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers should let the virus run through the flocks. Then, he has said, farmers should identify birds that survive the illness and study them to identify the source of their immunity. Many scientists assert that would be inhumane and dangerous.\n\nLast week, Mr. Kennedy urged the Canadian authorities not to kill 400 ostriches that had been exposed to H5N1, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who oversees Medicare and Medicaid, offered to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida.\n\nMr. Kennedy has long waged a campaign against some vaccines, particularly those based on mRNA. He has incorrectly and repeatedly said that the Covid vaccines using mRNA were the “deadliest” vaccines ever made.\n\nExperts said his views were out of step with the science.\n\n“Pandemic preparedness is about being proactive, fast and adaptable — the mRNA vaccine platform is all of that,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n“The rationale given is likely fabricated and more of a function of R.F.K. Jr.’s assault on vaccines, the value of which he evades,” he added. “Canceling this contract makes the world less safe.”",

        "content": "The Trump administration’s unprecedented $500 million grant for a broadly protective flu shot has confounded vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts, who said the project was in early stages, relied on old technology, and was just one of more than 200 such efforts.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shifted the money from a pandemic preparedness fund to a vaccine development program led by two scientists whom the administration recently named to senior positions at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nUse Our Content It can be republished for free.\n\nWhile some experts were pleased that Kennedy had supported any vaccine project, they said the May 1 announcement contravened sound scientific policy, appeared arbitrary, and raised the kinds of questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged many of President Donald Trump’s actions.\n\nFocusing vast resources on a single vaccine candidate “is a little like going to the Kentucky Derby and putting all your money on one horse,” said William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “In science we normally put money on a number of different horses because we can’t be entirely sure who’s going to win.”\n\nOthers were mystified by the decision, since the candidate vaccine uses technology that was largely abandoned in the 1970s and eschews techniques developed in recent decades through funding from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department.\n\n“This is not a next-generation vaccine,” said Rick Bright, who led HHS’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, in the first Trump administration. “It’s so last-generation, or first-generation, it’s mind-blowing.”\n\nEmail Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nThe vaccine is being developed at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases by Jeffery Taubenberger, whom Trump named as acting chief of the institute in late April, and his colleague Matthew Memoli, a critic of U.S. covid-19 policy whom Trump picked to lead the NIH until April 1, when Jay Bhattacharya took office. Bhattacharya named Memoli his principal deputy.\n\nTaubenberger gained fame as an Armed Forces Institute of Pathology scientist in 1997 when his lab sequenced the genome of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, using tissue samples from U.S. troops who died in that plague. He joined the NIH in 2006.\n\nIn a May 1 news release, HHS called the Taubenberger-Memoli vaccine initiative “Generation Gold Standard,” saying it represented “a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness.” Bhattacharya said it represented a “paradigm shift.”\n\nBut the NIH vaccine-makers’ goal of creating a shot that protects against multiple or all strains of influenza — currently vaccines must be given each year to account for shifts in the virus — is not new.\n\nThen-NIAID Director Anthony Fauci launched a network of academic researchers in pursuit of a broadly protective flu vaccine in 2019. In addition to that NIH-led consortium, more than 200 flu vaccines are under development in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nMany use newer technologies, and some are at more advanced stages of human testing than the Taubenberger vaccine, whose approach appears basically the same as the one used in flu vaccines starting in 1944, Bright said.\n\nIn the news release, HHS described the vaccine as “in advanced trials” and said it would induce “robust” responses and “long-lasting protection.” But Taubenberger and his colleagues haven’t published a complete human study of the vaccine yet. A study showing the vaccine protected mice from the flu appeared in 2022.\n\nFor Operation Warp Speed, which led to the creation of the covid vaccine during Trump’s first term, government scientists reviewed detailed plans and data from academic and commercial laboratories vying for federal money, said Greg Poland, a flu expert and president of the Atria Health Academy of Science and Medicine. “If that’s happening here, it’s opaque to me,” he said.\n\nWhen asked what data beyond its press release supported the decision, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon pointed to the agency’s one-page statement. Asked whether the decision would curtail funding for the Fauci-created consortium or other universal vaccine approaches, Nixon did not specifically respond. “Generation Gold Standard is the most promising,” he said in an email.\n\nTaubenberger did not respond to a request for comment. Nixon and NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine did not respond to requests for an interview with Taubenberger or Memoli.\n\nThe HHS statement stressed that by developing the vaccine in-house, the government “ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest.” While any vaccine would eventually have to be made commercially, NIH involvement through more stages of development could give the government greater influence on any vaccine’s eventual price, Schaffner said.\n\nIf the mRNA-based covid shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech represented the cutting edge of vaccine technology, applying ultra-sophisticated approaches never before seen in an inoculation, the approach by Taubenberger and Memoli represents a blast from the past.\n\nTheir vaccine is made by inactivating influenza viruses with a carcinogenic chemical called beta-propiolactone. Scientists have used the chemical to neutralize viruses since at least the 1950s. This whole-virus inactivation method, mostly using other chemicals, was the standard way to make flu vaccines into the 1970s, when it was modified, partly because whole-virus vaccines caused high fevers or even seizures in children.\n\nThe limited published data from the Taubenberger vaccine, from an initial safety trial involving 45 patients, showed no major side effects. The scientists are testing the vaccine as a regular shot and as an intranasal spray with the idea of stopping the virus in the respiratory tract before it causes a broad infection.\n\n“The notion of a universal influenza A pandemic vaccine is a good one,” said Poland, who called Taubenberger an excellent scientist. But he added: “I’m not so sure about the platform, and the dollar amount is a puzzler. This vaccine’s in very early development.”\n\nPaul Friedrichs, a retired Air Force general who led the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in President Joe Biden’s White House, said that “giving $500 million upfront with very little data to support it is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“The technology for developing vaccines has tremendously evolved over many decades,” Friedrichs said. “Why would we go back to an approach historically associated with greater or more frequent adverse events?”\n\nThe government appeared to be transferring the money for the Taubenberger vaccine development from an existing $1.3 billion vaccine fund at Project NextGen, a mostly covid-focused program at BARDA, Friedrichs said. Most of that money was earmarked to support advanced research on covid and other viral vaccines, including those protecting against emerging diseases.\n\nIt is “very concerning that we’re de-emphasizing covid, which we may live to regret,” Poland said. “It assumes we won’t have a covid variant that escapes the current moderately high levels of covid immunity.”\n\nNixon said Project NextGen, for which some funds were earmarked for mRNA research, is under review. Kennedy is critical of mRNA vaccines, once claiming, falsely, that they are the deadliest vaccines in history.\n\nTed Ross, director of global vaccine development at the Cleveland Clinic, said he was “happy to see them investing in respiratory vaccines, including a universal flu vaccine, with all the programs they’ve been cutting.”\n\n“But I don’t think this is the only approach,” Ross said. “Other universal flu vaccines are in progress, and their success and failure are not known yet.”\n\nHis team, part of the NIAID-funded flu vaccine consortium, is using artificial intelligence and computer modeling to design vaccines that produce the broadest immunity to influenza, including seasonal and pandemic strains.\n\nAs interim director, Memoli oversaw the start of the administration’s massive cuts at the NIH, with the elimination of some 800 agency grants worth over $2 billion. More than 1,200 NIH employees have been fired, and many researchers, including Ross, are in limbo.\n\nHis lab is close to testing a candidate vaccine on people, Ross said, while waiting to find out about its NIH funding. “I’m not sure whether my contract is on the chopping block,” he said.",

        "content": "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.\n\nThe company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.\n\nThe funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.\n\nThe new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.\n\nThe cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.\n\nHe added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.\n\n\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.\n\nIn a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. Céline Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"\n\nH5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.\n\nScientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.\n\nModerna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

        "content": "A retired New York police officer told a jury that he was acting in self-defense when he tackled a police officer and grabbed his gas mask during the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nJurors deliberated for less than three hours before convicting the 20-year NYPD veteran, Thomas Webster, of all six counts in his indictment.\n\nStream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now. WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\nWebster was the first Jan. 6 defendant to be tried on an assault charge and the first to present a jury with a self-defense argument. His conviction proved to be a bellwether for the dozens of trials that followed.\n\nFinding a viable trial defense hasn't been easy for rioters who stormed the Capitol. Of the nearly 100 riot defendants who have elected to a trial by jury, none has been fully acquitted.\n\nWe have the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter — delivered to your inbox daily. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nMany have said they were swept up in the moment. Some have tried to shift the blame for their actions to former President Donald Trump and his lies about a stolen election. Others have claimed they were trying to protect themselves from overzealous police officers.\n\nIn Webster's case, prosecutors repeatedly showed frame-by-frame footage of him assaulting a Metropolitan Police Department officer with a metal flagpole, tackling him to the ground and trying to rip off his gas mask.\n\nWebster testified he was trying to protect himself from a “rogue cop” who punched him in the face. A juror who spoke to reporters after the May 2022 verdict said the videos refuted Webster’s self-defense claims.\n\n“I guess we were all surprised that he would even make that defense argument,” the juror said. “There was no dissension among us at all. We unanimously agreed that there was no self-defense argument here at all.”\n\nBefore U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced him to 10 years in prison, Webster apologized to the officer. He said he wished he had never come to Washington, where he says he “became swept up in politics and former President Trump’s rhetoric.”\n\n“I wish the events of that horrible day had never happened. People would still be alive, people would not have gotten hurt, and families would not have been thrown apart. Perhaps our country would not be as divided as it is today,” Webster said.",

        "content": "US Department Of Defense Officially Designates ‘League Of Legends’, ‘Path Of Exile 2’ Parent Company Tencent As One Of Many “Chinese Military Companies” Operating Within The Country\n\nCommando Jarvan IV (Kyle Herbert) reports for duty in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nIn the latest escalation of geo-political tensions between the two world superpowers, a routine investigative procedure conducted by the United States’ Department of Defense has resulted in the China-based entertainment conglomerate Tencent being officially identified as one of the many “Chinese military companies” currently operating on Uncle Sam’s home turf.\n\nFire prove completely ineffective against the Count of Ogham’s forces in Path of Exile II (2025), Grinding Gear Games\n\nRELATED: Geoff Keighly’s The Game Awards Honored Amir Satvat As A Folk Hero For Laid Off Devs – In Reality He’s A Tencent Exec Who Runs A Glorified Unemployment List\n\nFor those unfamiliar with or in need of a refresher regarding the overtly-bureaucratic mechanics of the American government, to put it extremely succinctly, rather than having free access to Uncle Sam’s bank account, the country’s military, under the general jurisdiction of its Department of Defense, is instead given a yearly and variable operating budget, as determined and approved by Congress.\n\nPrior to 1961, the entire process was handled solely by the respective Appropriations committees of the governing body’s two chambers, the House and the Senate (and prior to 1867, the original Finance Committee). However, in 1961, Congress began making use of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), thus respectively dividing up the duties of budget usage determination and funding between the Senate and House’s individual Armed Services and Appropriations committees.\n\nGangplank (Dennis Collins Johnson) defends the colonies against the British in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nTo this end, when it came to the NDAA for 2021, all four bodies approved the inclusion of a new measure, as derived from an executive order from then-President Donald Trump barring American investment in China’s war fighting industry, requiring the Secretary of Defense to spend the next ten years “identify[ing] each entity the Secretary determines, based on the most recent information available, is operating directly or indirectly in the United States or any of its territories and possessions, that is a Chinese military company” and provide an annual report on their findings.\n\n“The term ‘Chinese military company’ does not include natural persons,” clarified Congress within the Act’s text. “and means an entity that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or beneficially owned by, or in an official or unofficial capacity acting as an agent of or on behalf of, the People’s Liberation Army or any other organization subordinate to the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party; or identified as a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base; and engaged in providing commercial services, manufacturing, producing, or exporting.”\n\nA Sorceress unleashes her lightning in Path of Exile II (2025), Grinding Gear Games\n\nRELATED: Ubisoft Continues To Implode As Founding Guillemot Brothers Reportedly Teaming With Chinese Tencent To Take ‘Assassin’s Creed Shadow’ Developer Private\n\nAnd it was in the Secretary’s latest round of determinations, as made publicly available on January 6th, that Tencent Holdings Limited – Perhaps most notable among this site’s readership for their video game-related holdings, which currently include full ownership over such entities as League of Legends developer Riot Games and Path of Exile duology team Grinding Gear Games, as well as a number of partial investments in such studios as Dark Souls series heralds FromSoftware and the ever-flailing Ubisoft – was confirmed to have received the ‘military company’ label.\n\nUnfortunately for those curious, at current, the US government has not disclosed just which aspects of the Chinese corporate giant’s operations have drawn their suspicions, with the Secretary’s official communique on the matter only containing a list of the infringing companies.\n\nGangplank (Dennis Collins Johnson) drops in for a sneak attack in League of Legends (2009), Riot Games\n\nFor their part, Tencent has rejected the Department of Defense’s findings, telling the press in a written statement, “[our] inclusion on this list is clearly a mistake.”\n\n“We are not a military company or supplier,” they asserted. “Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding.”\n\nLiliweiss (Yukari Tamura) tracks the whereabouts of the Red Hood (Yoko Hikasa) in Goddess of Victory: Nikke (2022), Shift Up/Tencent\n\nUnder the recently passed NDAA for 2024, starting in June 2026, the Department of Defense will no longer be allowed to directly purchase “goods services, or technology to provide a service that connects to the facilities of a third party, including backhaul, roaming, or interconnection arrangements” from Chinese military companies, and will be banned from doing so indirectly the following year.\n\nWhether Tencent will manage to convince the US government to remove them from said list before this ban takes effect remains to be seen.\n\nNEXT: New Update To Riot Games’ Terms Of Service Gives ‘League Of Legends’ Dev The Right To Respond To Players’ “Off-Platform Conduct” With “Penalties In-Game”\n\nSpencer Baculi By As of December 2023, Spencer is the Editor-in-Chief of Bounding Into Comics.

        "content": "has hundreds of unique weapons to choose from, ranging from traditional ballistic weapons to orbital cannons and throwing stars. The Riot-848 takes the familiar full-auto secondaries of conventional times and warps it with Entrati energy, allowing the gun's spent ammunition to feed back into the magazine between reloads.\n\nIt's an odd weapon to get used to, but it is certainly effective if you're willing to invest Forma into it. But before you can make a good build for it, you'll need to craft it first. This short guide will go over how to get the Riot-848, covering everything from drop rates to crafting requirements for each part.\n\n## How To Get The Riot-848\n\nThe Riot-848 is a drop from the **Solstice Square Defense mission in Hollvania**. You'll unlock access to all Warframe 1999 content upon completing \" \" questline. Once complete, use the 1999 terminal aboard your Orbiter to view all Hollvania missions. Solstice Square is the top left node on the map.\n\nThis mission functions identically to Lua Defense, requiring you to **defend Flare against waves of enemies. **After the first three waves, Flare's stage will collapse into the sewer system below. Flare will stay at this location for the rest of the mission. This area is far more claustrophobic than the surface and has more spawn locations for the enemies, leading to much faster waves if you have a strong loadout.\n\nAs for the weapon itself, **Riot-848 drops from each rotation in Solstice Square. **All parts can drop in each rotation (A, B, and C), although higher rotations have a higher drop chance. Remember that reward payouts go in the following order, with payouts being every three waves: AABC, AABC, AABC...\n\nIf you can't get any of the Riot-848's components to drop, **you can also purchase the blueprints from Flare directly in the Hollvania hub. **Components will require Beating Heartstrings to purchase this way, a currency you'll earn for successful wave clears. You'll need** 300 Beating Heartstrings **to purchase all Riot-848 components.\n\n### Riot-848 Drop Rates\n\nDrop rates were derived from Warframe PC Drops, a website hosted by Digital Extremes that shows exact drop rates for all items in Warframe. Despite the website name, drop rates are the same between PC and console.",

        "content": "Happy Friday! We are getting close to the 90-day deadline that President Donald Trump set back in January for the secretaries of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to recommend whether the president should invoke the Insurrection Act to address what he described as an “invasion” of gangs, human traffickers, and criminals at the southern border.\n\nMore than 10,000 service members are currently deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prevents federal troops from enforcing civilian laws within the United States. As such, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agents accompany troops on patrols to conduct any law enforcement activities.\n\nBut the Insurrection Act suspends Posse Comitatus when the country faces a rebellion, political violence, or other major incidents, said Risa Brooks, a political science professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin.\n\nGet Task & Purpose in Your Inbox Sign up for Task & Purpose Today to get the latest in military news each morning, and The Pentagon Rundown for a weekly breakdown of the biggest stories every Friday. Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n“If the Insurrection Act were invoked by a president, and the secretary of defense ordered it, the military would likely be able to apprehend migrants or clear the streets of protesters,” Brooks said.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush last invoked the law in 1992 in response to riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney King.\n\nIt’s worth noting that invoking the Insurrection Act is not the same as declaring martial law.\n\n“The difference from martial law is that the elected civilians remain in charge and civil law remains — the military are enforcing existing civil law, not making the laws,” said Kori Schake, head of the defense policy team at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. “They are legally empowered to behave as police, including to use lethal force to suppress insurrections, riots, and enforce the law.”\n\nAs always, there’s plenty more news. Here’s your weekly rundown.\n\nThat’s all a lot to process for one week. Stay tuned for more developments.\n\nJeff Schogol",

        "content": "Brigade N'Hamedu riot at an Eritrean festival in The Hague, 2024.\n\nThe Washington Post’s latest anti-Eritrea propaganda demonizes Eritrean immigrants defending themselves in the West.\n\nThe US has a lot of problematic friends in the Red Sea region, most notably Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Along with his habit of chopping off heads and having them hung in the public square, MBS is credited with having journalist Adnan Khashoggi dismembered with a bone saw at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has performed a record 213 public executions this year.\n\nMore Gulf monarchies distinguished by hair-raising human rights violations and even modern-day slavery include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Like Saudi Arabia, they all prop up the petrodollar, host US military bases, and purchase vast lethal supplies of US weapons, and all but Qatar backstab Palestine. None could disembowel enough kittens to fall afoul of US sanctions.\n\nAnd then of course there’s Israel.\n\nJust south and west of this ghastly pantheon is Eritrea, a Red Sea nation that defies the dictates of Western powers, pursues egalitarian social development, eschews IMF and World Bank debt, demands a fair price for its natural resources, and refuses to collaborate with AFRICOM, the US Africa Command.\n\nNot surprisingly, Eritrea is heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for alleged human rights abuse. Exclusion from the SWIFT system for conducting international financial transactions puts it in the exclusive company of the West’s other favorite bogeymen, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\n\nWestern politicians, pundits, and press relentlessly castigate Eritrea—never mind their headchopping friends across the Red Sea—with the most recent salvo coming from the Washington Post. The Biden Administration trained its soft power sights on the country, and this comes in its waning days.\n\nThe Post’s Nairobi correspondent, Katharine Houreld, authored the hit piece titled “How a tyrannical African country freely raises money in the U.S.” She notes that the US sanctioned Eritrea’s ruling party in 2021, alleges that the ruling party and the government are one and the same, and worries that it might be illegal to fundraise for a US sanctioned country in the US, citing anonymous experts who “said the practices deserve closer scrutiny, including the role played by nonprofit groups.” A US government Fact sheet says it’s legal to send humanitarian assistance to Cuba, which has been under US sanctions since 1962, so this threat of “close scrutiny” appears intended to intimidate Eritrean Americans.\n\nAt least 14 nonprofits raise money to be spent in Israel, including two, Israel Friends and Friends of the Israel Defense Force (FIDF), who raise funds directly for the IDF. That’s just for the record, given that Israel is of course not sanctioned by the US.\n\nFundraising for a lawsuit to protect Eritrean Americans\n\nA careful read of Katharine Houreld’s piece makes it clear that very little of the fundraising it decries is about funds to be spent by the Eritrean government or even to be spent in Eritrea. It's about a Zoom call which she claims was intended to raise money for a lawsuit against people who’ve attacked Eritrean Americans at cultural festivals and events here in the US, specifically for their attack on the Eritrean American Festival in the Seattle-Tacoma area in August 2023. Houreld also mentions past fundraising for COVID relief and cancer care in Eritrea.\n\nI attended the 2022 Eritrean Festival in Dallas, where someone gave a presentation on delivering improved cancer care. People in the audience then stood up, one after another, glowing and eager to announce contributions on behalf of their local Eritrean American communities.\n\nThere was no fundraising of any sort at the 2023 festival in Seattle or the 2024 festival in Washington DC.\n\nHoureld also writes that these are festivals \"where women in diaphanous white dresses twirl in traditional dances, pro-government musicians croon before rapt audiences, and attendees feast on steaming bowls of Eritrean cuisine.\" Oh . . . My . . .God. Sounds like fun. As one Eritrean American responded on X, “We don’t need the government or the Washington Post’s permission to have a good time!”\n\nHoureld is writing about the Seattle festival from Nairobi, but I was there. The hooligans arrived at 6 a.m., waking us up to loud sounds of destruction and gunshots. They tore down exhibition tents, vandalized property, even set Eritrean dresses on fire, and paraded around waving American flags and blue-and-green Brigade N’Hamedu flags. They later sent several festival goers to the nearest emergency room.\n\nMany Brigade N’Hamedu militants seem to have emigrated from the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, which lost its 2020-2022 war with the Ethiopian government aided by Eritrea. Others seem to be Eritreans from near the border between Tigray and Eritrea who identify as Tigrayans.\n\nWestern countries give special preference to migrants from Eritrea, as they do Cubans and Venezuelans, in an attempt to depopulate those countries of their gifted and educated youth. The Daily Mail recently published an exposé about Tigrayans on TikTok, bragging that they had managed to “con their way into Britain” by claiming to be Eritrean and “sharing huge swathes of training material to convince case officers they are from Eritrea.”\n\nAt least three individuals named in the EAGS lawsuit are of Tigrayan origin. Temesgen Kahsay, a named defendant who identifies as Tigrayan, openly admits on social media that “a large portion of the Eritrean opposition are Tigrayans. Others are Tigrayan by their mother or father’s ancestry lines.” This statement is supported by ongoing investigations. For example, in Germany, where the first attack occurred in a parliamentary hearing, German politician Jörg-Uwe Hahn notes that “the perpetrators of violence are violent groups led by the probably extremist organization 'Brigade N'Hamedu' from Tigray (Northern Ethiopia).\" The narrative that Eritreans are “clashing” continues to erode.\n\nThe militants are on a mission to undermine and violently attack Eritrean expat communities throughout the West, from Stockholm to Seattle and even Tel Aviv. In 2023, they attacked festivals and events in those cities and in Giessen and Stuttgart, Germany, London, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Denver, Dallas, St. Louis, and Atlanta. In 2024, they attacked in The Hague, Breslau, London, Indianapolis, Charlotte, and again Tel Aviv (church service) and Atlanta.\n\nThe group openly operates with a “Plan A” to warn municipal authorities and venue owners that there may be violence and prevent them from granting permits for Eritrean-themed events. Their “Plan B” is to attack the events if that fails.\n\nAt the beginning of her essay, Katharine Houreld writes, “Earlier this year, for example, about 100 Eritreans living across the United States joined a Zoom call co-hosted by officials from the Eritrean Embassy aimed at raising money to support their country’s struggle against its opponents,” which of course sounds repressive. No government should struggle against its opponents, should they? Especially not against opponents favored by the US government, opponents who might even be attempting a color revolution.\n\n“The Eritrean chargé d’affaires,” Houreld continues, “pressed those on the call to hold their own fundraising events and to urge fellow members of the diaspora to contribute as much as they could.”\n\nIt then takes Houreld another eleven paragraphs to acknowledge that the fundraising that she believes took place on this Zoom call was neither for money to be spent by the Eritrean government, nor even to be spent within the borders of Eritrea. She believes that it was instead to be spent by the Eritrean Association in Greater Seattle (EAGS) in support of their legal complaint against the hooligans who attacked their festival.\n\n“The Eritrean officials on the call said the money, in this instance,” she finally writes, “would finance a lawsuit in the United States against demonstrators who had been protesting against Eritrean government abuses.”\n\nDemonstrators protesting? Brigade N’Hamedu proudly documented their own EAGS festival riot on social media livestreams and then posted it to a YouTube channel. A number of the defendants in the lawsuit can be easily identified in the video.\n\nUnlike the constant stream of Western media propaganda demonizing Eritreans, Brigade N’Hamedu’s violent attacks are creating evidence that they are violating the laws of host countries across the West.\n\nAs earlier reported here, investigations of the many 2023 attacks are underway, and in Calgary, 28 people have been indicted on 63 criminal charges.\n\nCalgary Chief Constable Mark Neufeld told local news, “We’re not policing ideologies. We don’t get on one side or the other of this. This is around behavior for us, and so the behavior that we see in the videos and the reporting of this is the very same behavior that we’ve seen in other cities, and it’s not OK. It’s not OK in our city.”\n\nNeufeld also said that these were not clashes between two groups but violent attacks by one group upon another.\n\nThe list of Brigade N’Hamedu attackers who have been indicted and/or convicted keeps growing. Hundreds have been arrested and charged around the world. Global kingpin John Black was sentenced to four years for the Hague attack.\n\nNotable charges in the USA, include Kidane Woldemariam, who faces felony assault charges with a deadly weapon; he allegedly shot Eritreans at a peaceful event in November 2023. Haile Tseada, a defendant in the EAGS lawsuit, was arrested and charged with assaulting Charlotte police in the February 2024 riot.\n\nThere have been no more attacks since the EAGS filed their federal complaint.\n\nAnother lawsuit based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which makes it illegal to participate in organized crime, is in the works.\n\nAnn Garrison is a Black Agenda Report Contributing Editor based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

A police van was also set on fire, as violence took place just a few streets away from where the vigil was held.\n\nopen image in gallery One officer is suspected to have suffered a broken nose during the disturbances ( Pat Hurst/PA Wire )\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday night, Merseyside Police said they believed supporters of the English Defence League (EDL) were behind the disturbances.\n\nThe far-right group has a strong presence on social media, where leaders will mobilise supporters. It was once led by Tommy Robinson, with many members chanting his name during the events.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the anti-Islam hate organisation:\n\nWho are the English Defence League (EDL)?\n\nFounded in 2009, the EDL is a far-right, Islamophobic pressure group. Its members will often mobilise for street demonstrations against immigration and multi-culturalism, and sometimes mount counter-action to protests with progressive aims.\n\nThe group rose to prominence between 2009 and 2012, during much of which it was informally led by Robinson. Real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, Robinson was imprisoned several times during these years for violent or disruptive behaviour.\n\nMany of the early EDL members were recruited from Luton football club supporters, Robinson’s home town team. The group has links to football hooliganism.\n\nThe EDL’s rise coincided with the decline of the British National Party as an electoral force. The far-right political party gained over half a million votes at the 2010 general election, a record-high. It has now faded into electoral obscurity.\n\nopen image in gallery Tommy Robinson marches with supporters in central London ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\nRobinson stood down as leader of the EDL in 2013, citing fears over the “dangers of far-right extremism.” The same year, he would publicly apologise to Muslim communities and offer to give evidence to the police to aid their investigation of EDL members.\n\nHe has since been convicted for contempt of court and stalking, and was most recently arrested on 28 July under anti-terror laws. The 41-year-old had screened a film to supporters in central London repeating false claims he had made about a Syrian refugee, over which he lost a libel case in 2021.\n\nHis arrest came after he organised a counter-protest to a Stand Up To Racism march that was happening in the capital on July 27. Engaging with his supporters on Facebook, he said the event would be the “biggest patriotic rally the UK has ever seen.” Nine of his supporters were arrested after clashes with the police.\n\nopen image in gallery Members of the right-wing EDL take part in a protest in Tower Hamlets, east London on September 3, 2011. ( Carl Court/AFP via Getty Images )\n\nLast year, right-wing protesters mobilised in the city on Armistice Day to mount a counter-protest to the weekly pro-Palestine marches which have been ongoing during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The group clashed with police at the Cenotaph, and 145 people were arrested, most of whom belonged to the counter-protesters.\n\nSpeaking after the events then-prime minister Rish Sunak said: “I condemn the violent, wholly unacceptable scenes we have seen today from the EDL and associated groups and Hamas sympathisers attending the National March for Palestine.”\n\nDespite a decline over the past decade, EDL members are known to mobilise after certain events to express anti-Islam views, such as the attack in Southport. Members are thought to have also spread to other far-right groups such as National Action and Patriotic Alternative, which also organise protests.",

        "content": "Ecuador's first round of presidential voting in early February was unprecedented. Incumbent President Daniel Noboa and opposition leftist candidate Luisa González monopolized 90% of the vote, leaving the other 14 candidates with single-digit percentages and at least 12 who failed to reach even 1%. The atypical results came with an extraordinary period of violent threats and acts against politicians regardless of their leanings.\n\nLast December, President Noboa reported that the National Police had found a car bomb near a neighborhood in El Oro, where he had planned to make a campaign stop. González reported receiving death threats and placed her security in the hands of the nation's armed forces. Socialist candidate Pedro Granja suspended his campaign events after an attack. Centrist Jimmy Jairala's car was shot at the start of his campaign, and leftist candidate Andrea González decided to wear a bulletproof vest during her public appearances.\n\nViolence seems to be everywhere in Ecuador, affecting its education, health care, and politics. The candidates vying to lead the South American country—considered in recent years to be one of the most violent in the world—are well aware of this reality. Insecurity is the primary concern of their voters. Seven in 10 Ecuadorians fear going out at night, and the country ranks worst on Gallup's Law and Order Index, which annually measures the perception of security in 140 countries.\n\nViolence seems to be everywhere in Ecuador, affecting its education, health care, and politics\n\nOn April 13, when Noboa and González face off in the presidential runoff, violence could play an unparalleled role in voter decision-making.\n\nViolent threats against Ecuador's politicians are remnants of a deep national wound yet to heal. In August 2023, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated just ten days before the election. Since then, 30 politicians, including elected officials, have been murdered.\n\nThe security crisis complicates daily life even in places once considered safe havens, such as schools and hospitals. According to the Ministry of Education, approximately 90,000 children have dropped out of school since 2022, making Ecuador a record-holder as a country unfit for children. Homicide is the leading cause of death among Ecuadorian minors, and ever since criminal gangs normalized extorting students in exchange for permission to attend school, the NGO Plan International reports that 20% of children actively try to avoid classes due to fear of violence.\n\nAs schools become no-go zones, hospitals turn into cemeteries. The country had become accustomed to high levels of violence, averaging nearly 2,000 alerts of attacks in hospitals per year, according to the Ministry of Health. In recent months, doctors and hospital administrators have been murdered, kidnapped, and extorted, prompting authorities to take extreme measures, including to close a health-care center in Durán—a coastal city of nearly 400,000 people that, in 2023, was the homicide capital of the world.\n\nA patient suffering from COVID-19 receives medical attention at the Quito South Social Security Institute dining hall, in Quito, Ecuador, on April 9, 2021. REUTERS/Santiago Arcos\n\nEcuador's surge in violence is linked to the explosion of organized crime. Last November, The Economist dubbed Ecuador the world's newest narco-state. The reasons are plentiful. Judges, police officers, and prosecutors are accused of working for drug cartels. Three Ecuadorian cities rank among the 50 most violent in the world. According to Italy's ambassador to Ecuador, Giovanni Davoli, \"70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador.\" Davioli represents European security cooperation against the South American mafia. President Noboa estimated the \"size of Ecuador's criminal economy at around $30 billion USD\"—meaning that roughly one in every four dollars circulating in the country is tainted with blood and cocaine.\n\nBreaking the Cycle of Violence\n\nExperts such as former Army General Commander Luis Altamirano believe that Ecuador is stuck in a cycle of ineffective policies. In theory, the government has tried everything: border closures, states of emergency, declarations of internal armed conflict, harsher penalties, and international cooperation. Yet, after a brief slowdown during 2024, violent deaths are once again rising and are expected to break new records. \"There is no long-term vision for addressing the security problem,\" Altamirano reflects. \"We don't even know what the official public security policy is, nor what kind of reforms are planned—if any.\"\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter Sign up for our weekly newsletter to stay up to date.

Look for your next weekly newsletter in your inbox.\n\nAs these trends persist, the two leading candidates continue to blame each other. Noboa, who has governed for just a year and a half and seeks reelection for a full four-year term, argues that he has not had enough time to tackle the violence. He says he has faced opposition roadblocks and that his predecessors opened the doors to organized crime. González, on the other hand, accuses the incumbent president of lacking an action plan, improvising amid the security crisis, and dismantling the 2000s era crime-fighting policies of her party's former government—when, she claims, Ecuador was one of the safest countries in the region.\n\nWith weeks still left in the campaign and a presidential debate ahead, both candidates will be expected to move beyond vague rhetoric and broad statements on security. No matter who wins the most votes on April 13, Ecuadorians expect real results against violent crime.\n\nPeople leave after casting their votes at the Cesar Arroyo school during the presidential elections, in Cayambe, Ecuador, on August 20, 2023.

        "content": "A repeat of the January 6, 2021, assault on Congress is in my view unlikely. Trump is not in the White House and Kamala Harris, not Mike Pence, is the Vice President. Charging the Capitol building to prevent a peaceful transfer of power is pointless this time. In any case, the leaders of the groups that conspired to lead the mob in 2021 are not available to orchestrate another raid. They are in prison. Close to 1,300 January 6 rioters have been charged and prosecuted or are awaiting trial. Many did plea bargains that also will keep them at home.\n\nElection violence is almost guaranteed but it will be localized. We know this script. Self-deployed heavily armed militants will turn up at election sites and intimidate voters and election officials under the guise of “protecting” the election. Safeguarding the election against small-town vigilantes will be challenging. The Trump campaign, already anticipating a loss, is mobilizing a “Stop the Steal” campaign and preparing slates of fake electors who will reject certification should Harris win. Election officials and volunteers are already bombarded with death threats. The difference between a real threat and a ‘ha-ha’ threat is irrelevant when you are on the receiving end. They are all real.\n\nTrump has accused Harris and the Democrats of inciting violence against him when they say he is a threat to democracy. The charge is disingenuous. The perpetrators of the two recent assassination attempts on Trump had donated small sums to both parties, and one of them had voted for Trump in 2016. Would-be assassins are more likely to be motivated by martyrdom fantasies or desires for fame than partisan political motives.",

        "content": "A hard-won peace may be largely prevailing in the southern Philippines, but not all is quiet in the camps of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). As the region’s Muslim Moro people await the first ever and oft-delayed parliamentary elections of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the MILF, whose decades-long separatist armed struggle culminated in a peace agreement with the national government in 2014 and the creation of the BARMM in 2019, finds itself confronted by a violence older than that of its former adversaries from the national government: war between clans, traditionally called “rido.”\n\nIt is not the violence any ideologically committed MILF fighter had arguably signed up to confront, but it has claimed the lives of many a fighter. On 10 August 2022, for example, two factions of the MILF, each identified with rival clans, engaged in a firefight in Pikit town, Cotabato, in which four people were killed, including a civilian. The fighting led to the evacuation of hundreds of villagers and required the intervention of military, police, and local government officials to stop. Similarly, on 4 September 2024, the rival Aragasi and Usman clans, both affiliated with the MILF, engaged in a firefight in Parang town, Maguindanao del Norte, killing four. The fighting erupted over a long-running land dispute between the two clans.\n\nSuch fighting related to clan blood feuds concerns not only the MILF but also the wider Moro society. Precisely for this reason, it cannot be downplayed as a threat to the peace process, especially as the fate of the around 15,000 MILF fighters who have yet to undergo decommissioning depends on the success of the BARMM polls. The first polls — delayed multiple times for different reasons ranging from COVID-19 to (most recently) the belated exclusion of Sulu province from BARMM — are understood to be the completion of the government and MILF’s mutual commitments to each other under the 2014 peace agreement. The peace process is thus entering a critical homestretch that demands just enough calm from all armed stakeholders for a full-fledged autonomous government to emerge — through the ballot box rather than through arms.\n\nThe MILF is not unaware of the persistent challenge rido poses to its own ranks and has tried for years to resolve clan conflicts between its members. When the MILF announced the end of two clan wars in 2011, it acknowledged that such rido conflicts are obstacles to peace. Later, in June 2020, the MILF celebrated its resolution of what it called the biggest rido in the formerly unified Maguindanao province (split into Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur in 2022). At the time, the MILF asserted that the peace agreement between the Sindatok and Tundok clans, which respectively led the MILF’s 105th and 118th Base Commands, would eliminate “half of the rido problem in Maguindanao.”\n\nAll eyes are now waiting to see whether the MILF will do better than its historical predecessor, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), in dealing with rido. The MNLF, founded in 1972, signed its own peace agreement with the national government in 1996 and consequently governed the earlier Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) region that preceded BARMM. The MNLF-led ARMM was largely seen as a failure, not only because the MILF (which had split from the MNLF by 1977 over strategic differences) continued its rebellion, but also because the MNLF was seen to have failed in asserting political legitimacy over powerful local clans. Rido now threatens to once again be a stumbling block to the MILF and the national government’s efforts to establish a lasting peace in Mindanao.\n\nRido violence and clan-based social structures in BARMM\n\nRido violence is traditionally defined as clan-based violence between Moro Muslim clans. The existence of rido itself illustrates the strong clan-based dynamics that persist in the region, which far predate the separatist political movements that shaped Mindanao’s political history over the last few decades. ACLED records over 150 rido events since 2018. Unsurprisingly, most rido violence persists in present-day BARMM, which accounts for around 80% of all such events since 2018, but also to a significant degree in the neighboring Soccsksargen region (see map below). Most such events have no relation to MILF or other armed group activity.\n\nUsing reports of violent events from local and national media, ACLED has recorded violent incidents related to rido from 2018 onward. ACLED classifies events as rido-related if a report on political violence explicitly refers to rido as the cause or likely cause. On rare occasions when reports do not explicitly refer to rido, they may still use very similar language, referring to “clan blood feuds” or fighting between clans in the Muslim-majority part of Mindanao, the traditional homeland of the Moro people. This area is now mostly in present-day BARMM, but rido events have also been recorded in neighboring regions, including Soccsksargen, Northern Mindanao, and Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\nSurveying ACLED data on rido violence reveals its multifaceted nature. Motives for specific outbreaks of violence range from the overtly political to the decidedly personal. Given the overall security implications and social significance of rido in clan-based Mindanao society, all such events are included in the ACLED dataset, whether they are attributed to electoral competition or a personal grudge.\n\nOne of the most cited reasons for deadly rido violence is competition over land. A firefight between the rival Impos and Magao clans on 18 September 2020, which killed two militiamen from each group, is a typical example of a clan-based dispute over land that turned lethal. But land is not the only reason cited in outbreaks of violence. For example, in April 2021, a member of the Jaljalis clan was killed by Aspali clan militiamen in Sumisip town, Basilan, after he was caught having an affair with the Aspali clan leader’s sister-in-law. The Jaljalis clan then retaliated, resulting in the death of an Aspali clan member. Meanwhile, on 10 November 2024, two cousins were reportedly killed and two others wounded in a clash between clans in Balabagan town, Lanao del Sur. The fight stemmed from a simple argument over Facebook posts. The relatives of the slain cousins retaliated by setting fire to a truck owned by the opposing side.\n\nThere are even cases reported as rido that may not involve fighting between two Moro clans. But even these cases are rooted in the complicated history of Mindanao, including the central state’s policy of resettling non-Moro Muslim people in the territory throughout the 20th century. Thus, on 25 January 2017, three members of an Ilonggo clan — non-Muslim people originating from Western Visayas in the central Philippines — were injured in a rido-related ambush by a Moro family in Sultan Kudarat town, Maguindanao. The resettling of non-Muslim (typically Christian) Filipinos throughout Mindanao that began during the American colonial era, and the resulting displacement of Moro Muslims, is one of the historical grievances that led to the Moro rebellion that began in the 1970s.\n\nThese are but a handful of examples of rido-related fighting, but there is reason to believe that rido — while highly researched by scholars — is a significantly underreported phenomenon, given that most rido incidents happen in remote places that might not always receive media attention. Thus, while ACLED data indicate a rise in rido events in the past years (see graph below), ACLED’s reports-based figure is likely an undercount. In any case, the establishment of transitional MILF-led BARMM institutions in 2019 failed to stem rido-related violence.\n\nRido interaction with other conflicts\n\nACLED data show that the persistence of rido violence in BARMM and surrounding regions often also involves actors with identities that are not inherently centered on rido, the most prominent of which are the MILF and MNLF.\n\nWhen university-educated ideologues first started waging the separatist armed struggle for the Moro people in the 1970s, giving birth first to the MNLF and later the MILF, these early revolutionaries couched their groups’ ideological language in the ideals of self-determination. But while these national separatist struggles appealed to globalized norms of self-determination, local realities play a decisive role in how such appeals turn out. The scholarship on violence in Bangsamoro has thus focused on the difficulty that new democratic structures face in establishing their political legitimacy vis-à-vis more traditional sources of political legitimacy, such as clans.\n\nThe MILF and MNLF movements in Mindanao have historically sought to frame their projects of political autonomy in the same terms as, paradoxically, the national state they opposed: the creation of modern political institutions that fulfill the responsibilities expected of a state. Thus, even with the shift of their political projects from full separatism to regional autonomy, the MILF and the MNLF now align themselves with the central state, as well as international development cooperation agencies, in embracing the language of “good governance” as the solution to social ills.\n\nHowever, implementing international democratic norms locally will not automatically dislodge a society’s traditional sources of political legitimacy. Local populations still need convincing that new institutions will respond to their needs better than, say, the powerful local clans that previously guaranteed their security and livelihood. Such institutions will thus have to be proven more “legitimate” than the clans. In the case of Bangsamoro, good governance advocates now working in the framework of rebel-won autonomy therefore risk a disconnect with local communities if they ignore the traditional clan-based power structures, which far precede the rebellions.\n\nWhat is at stake is the very authority of the rebels-turned-leaders now at the helm of the supposedly innovative and democratic new autonomous region. Their authority is quickly undermined when the violence emanating from the traditional clan-based power structures remains unchecked. This is especially true given that other armed actors otherwise engaged in conflict outside the framework of rido also take part in clan-based violence, affirming the stubborn political centrality of clans.\n\nAs ACLED data from 2018 onward show, a third of rido violence has involved the MILF, MNLF, and other armed groups, such as Abu Sayyaf and Dawlah Islamiyah affiliates like the Hassan Group, on at least one side of a clash (see graph below). Abu Sayyaf is a long-standing Islamist fundamentalist group with historic ties to al-Qaeda, while Dawlah Islamiyah is a loose umbrella term for several Islamic State-inspired groups that first rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and reached a height of activity during the 2017 siege on Marawi city. Though these diverse groups are largely connected only by their presence in Mindanao, one commonality is that none of them was inherently constituted to engage in rido violence.\n\nThe armed group whose members are most involved in rido violence is the MILF itself. In fact, of all the political violence events that have seen at least some MILF involvement since 2018, 35% are related to rido. This figure represents a considerable strain on the MILF-led BARMM’s credibility in managing rido violence in the region. It also highlights how the interconnectedness of different conflicts in Bangsamoro means that the resources available to an armed group may also play a role in pursuing goals external to the group. After all, the MILF members involved were ostensibly armed in service of the MILF’s ideological goals of political autonomy for Moro Muslims. But their implication in rido violence shows that they may also be using their weapons to serve other purposes. Rido thus compounds the volume of violence attributable to an armed group, even if such violence lies outside a group’s self-understanding.\n\nRido may even play a role in the occasional clashes that break out between armed groups, which otherwise — apart from the MILF and the MNLF, since their respective peace agreements with the government — would normally engage only in armed clashes with state forces. For example, on 11 September 2023, two Dawlah Islamiyah–Hassan Group militants were reportedly killed and three others wounded in a firefight with the MILF in Datu Hoffer Ampatuan town in Maguindanao del Sur. The fighting caused Teduray tribespeople to evacuate. Authorities directly blamed a long-standing rido for the fighting between the Dawlah Islamiyah and the MILF militants.\n\nMNLF fighters, too, have engaged in firefights with the MILF. Two rival clans, respectively affiliated with the MILF and the MNLF, fought in several villages in Pikit town, Cotabato, on 10 May 2020. Despite no reports of casualties, the effects of the violence were not confined to the fighters, as the rival militias burned homes and looted property and livestock in the area. The local government, and both the MILF and MNLF, intervened to end the fighting, which was attributed to a land dispute.\n\nThese examples show that armed groups may sometimes be pulled into patterns of violence with a longer history than their own.\n\nThe threat of rido violence to the BARMM elections and the larger peace process\n\nElevated levels of violence have historically accompanied election periods in the Philippines, and the first-ever Bangsamoro parliamentary election is not likely to be different. In fact, several rido events have been attributed to electoral competition, and at least 26 rido-related attacks have been directed against elected representatives and other local state officials since 2018. Some specific rido-related events have also been expressly attributed to electoral competition. For example, on 24 September 2024, two individuals were reportedly killed in a clash between the Abdul and Macud clans in Malabang town, Lanao del Sur. The incident also wounded four people and led hundreds of residents to flee. The conflict was said to originate from a dispute during the 2019 local elections between the two clans.\n\nThe question for the 2025 BARMM polls would then be whether the powerful clans participating in the parliamentary elections are going to keep such competition to the ballot box or resort to violence in an attempt to influence the results. The single most prominent player in the upcoming elections is, of course, the MILF itself. Though it is officially participating in the polls through its organizationally separate affiliated political party, the United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP), the MILF and its remaining armed strength of about 15,000 fighters remain this party’s backbone. After all, in line with the 2014 peace agreement, the full decommissioning process of MILF fighters is not expected to be finished until the completion of the peace process, which is meant to be capped by the polls. So far, around 25,000 MILF fighters have been decommissioned by the third of four decommissioning phases as of 2023. Government officials have publicly announced their intent to complete the decommissioning process, which includes third-party international observers, right in time for the BARMM parliamentary elections. With the postponement of the polls, now scheduled for October 2025, the decommissioning progress is presently unclear.\n\nBARMM politicians who are unaffiliated with the MILF have expressed concern about the group’s continued armed strength going into the polls, as the official decommissioning protocol of the 2014 peace agreement only provides for the decommissioning of 35% of all MILF fighters by the third (pre-final) phase. In 2023, four BARMM provincial governors called on the government to hasten the decommissioning process. The governors argued that the MILF’s armed presence, coupled with the “peace process mechanisms” in place, barred police and military from implementing law enforcement operations in areas considered “MILF territory.” During the 2019 autonomy plebiscite that established the BARMM, some quarters also expressed fears about a possible outbreak of violence in case Cotabato City, now the BARMM capital, did not vote to join the then-proposed autonomous region, given the city’s symbolic importance for the MILF.\n\nIn contrast to politicians publicly expressing concern about the MILF’s continued armed strength, the group has instead pointed to powerful local politicians’ private armies as the threat to peace and order. Responding to the BARMM governors’ call, MILF leader and former BARMM Chief Minister Ahod “Murad” Ebrahim said there was no problem with a faster decommissioning, but he emphasized the need for a corresponding dismantling of politicians’ private armies.\n\nWith MILF members themselves often involved in armed clashes between clans, third-party observers have emphasized the mutual importance of decommissioning MILF fighters and dismantling clans’ private armies. On the same track, the government has stressed the importance of instituting nonviolent resolution mechanisms for rido disputes to protect the gains of the peace process. The MILF-led Bangsamoro transitional government has therefore engaged in regionwide consultation efforts for the prevention and settlement of rido disputes.\n\nThese efforts notwithstanding, the history of election-related violence in the Philippines gives reason for concern that a heightened risk of violence during the elections could be posed by confluent factors, including electoral competition between clans, electoral participation of a heavily armed MILF, and the presence of clan militias and private armies across BARMM.\n\nTensions will run especially high given that powerful and influential clans are fielding their members to contest the parliamentary elections. Some have even banded together to form larger coalitions to face off with the MILF’s own party — though the alliances seem to be fluid and shifting. For example, three of four regionally prominent clans that previously allied as the Bangsamoro Grand Coalition to contest the UBJP in the October 2025 polls later declared allegiance to the UBJP.\n\nIn the face of persistent rido violence, the future Bangsamoro government will be tasked with the tall order of convincing its Moro constituents — including the powerful clans that make up its elite — that the new institutions and mechanisms will serve as a more effective recourse than rido in solving the disputes that shape Moro social life. The elections promise to be the first test. Their success will require just enough faith in the future of Bangsamoro for the MILF and clan-based militias to lay down their arms.",

Frelimo has been in power since 1975.\n\nMultiple news reports indicate that violent and repressive measures were used by security forces against protesters who were taking part in peaceful demonstrations which continued until 7 November, causing at least 30 deaths – including a child – and injuring a further 200.\n\nAt least 300 protesters have also been arrested in connection with these demonstrations.\n\nAccording to reports, authorities deployed the military last week to stop the protests, while protest leaders have announced multiple phases of demonstrations, including at provincial capitals and border crossings.\n\nProtesters have also allegedly carried out reprisals against suspected police officers, including at least one killing, according to authorities.\n\nViolence very disturbing\n\n“The violations of the right to life, including of a child, deliberate killings of unarmed protesters and the excessive use of force by the police deployed to disperse peaceful protests across Mozambique are very disturbing,” the Human Rights Council-appointed independent experts said.\n\n“We call on the Mozambican authorities to promptly and impartially investigate all the unlawful killings.”\n\nQuestions on electoral integrity\n\nThe protests emerged as citizens questioned the integrity of the elections, which were marked by accusations of irregularities.\n\n“Authorities need to take steps to halt the violence and ensure an environment in which all Mozambicans, including women and girls, can participate fully and equally in the political processes and express themselves without fear,” the experts said.\n\nRestrictions to media freedoms have also been widely reported, including attacks, intimidation and harassment of journalists, and intermittent internet and mobile network blockages.\n\nHuman rights defenders reporting on the irregularities of the election process or participating in protests have been intimidated and threatened.\n\nRights must be upheld\n\nThe rights experts also emphasised that law enforcement personnel “have a duty to respect and protect” those who are exercising right to peaceful assembly and that they remain neutral and impartial during protests.\n\nThey must “prevent harm and protect the right to life, liberty and security” of those involved, the experts said.\n\n“We urge Mozambican authorities to facilitate access to information for all and strongly condemn the widespread disruption of internet services,” they continued.\n\nThe UN experts – who are not UN staff, receive no salary and do not represent any government or organization – warned that enforced disappearances and acts of violence linked to electoral disputes could have enduring consequences on the country’s democratic framework.\n\nThey confirmed ongoing dialogue with Mozambican authorities and pledged to closely monitor the evolving situation.",

        "content": "Many Americans are worried that if former President Donald Trump loses to Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, he and his Make American Great Again (MAGA) supporters will cry foul, and some may engage in violence. Almost two-thirds of Republicans believe that Trump won four years ago, and they may say the same thing this year if Harris wins. Trump himself has fed this red meat to his base, saying on several occasions that the only way he will lose is if the election is rigged.\n\nA repeat of the violence at the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021, when legislators met to formally approve the electoral college results of President Joe Biden’s victory, is unlikely to occur because Biden will still be in office for the January 6, 2025 counting and certification of the 2024 results. Unlike Trump’s actions as president in January 2021, Biden is already overseeing heightened security measures for January 6 and will move quickly to provide security around this venerable institution and denounce and shut down violence. But there is a good chance that sporadic acts of violence could occur against other individuals and institutions. Violence is possible against Harris supporters, immigrants, minorities, and others if Trump loses and refuses to accept the results, and his diehard supporters vent their anger in dangerous ways.\n\nThe Erosion of Norms, Standards, and Decorum\n\nOne of the hallmarks of American democracy has been the peaceful transfer of power after elections. Although no politician likes to lose, for nearly two and a half centuries, with the exception of the events leading up to the Civil War in the early 1860s, the defeated presidential candidate has conceded the race to his opponent after most of the votes have been counted, often in a gracious way, as former Republican candidate John McCain did in 2008. Even when a candidate and his supporters have suspected foul play—for example, in the very tight 1960 presidential election, some of Richard Nixon’s Republican party supporters believed that Democratic Mayor Richard Daley rigged the vote count in Chicago in order for John F. Kennedy to carry the state of Illinois—there was no violence in the election aftermath. Indeed, none other than Nixon himself, who was known as “Tricky Dick” to his detractors and later had to resign in disgrace in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, told a close confidant at the time that he would not contest the 1960 election outcome because “our country cannot afford the agony of a constitutional crisis.” Nixon seemed to believe that, in the interests of preserving American democracy, it was better to concede to Kennedy than to challenge the results.\n\nTrump has thrown such commendable behavior out the window. Not only did he refuse to concede to Biden after the 2020 contest, in an election that was deemed not fraudulent by his own attorney general, William Barr, he even tried to pressure Georgia state officials shortly after the election to “find” him the necessary votes to win that state. Trump’s campaign filed scores of lawsuits to contest the results in various states, but they were all dismissed by the courts. Nonetheless, Trump and most of his supporters refused to accept the fact that Biden won the election, and Trump did not even attend Biden’s inauguration ceremony as is customary.\n\nBut the most egregious post-election action was the storming of the US Capitol by thousands of Trump’s supporters on January 6, 2021, to disrupt the formal count of the electoral college vote and to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to Biden. Trump had urged them on, even knowing that some were armed. It later came to light in congressional hearings that Trump watched television in the White House for several hours while his supporters were engaged in violence, and did not seem to care that his own Vice President Mike Pence, who had a constitutional duty to certify the electoral college results, was in danger from a mob chanting “hang Mike Pence.”\n\nIn the current election cycle, Trump has said repeatedly he would pardon the January 6 rioters, hundreds of whom have already been convicted by the courts, with many still serving jail time, and has called them “warriors.” Trump has even referred to January 6, 2021, a “day of love.”\n\nIn addition, Trump has lowered the bar on speech, charging that Harris has low intelligence and has been a “[expletive] vice president.” It is not surprising, therefore, that Trump’s supporters have echoed this and other profanities at his rallies and have demonized Harris and her supporters. Trump has mentioned that some religious leaders, who are part of his support base, have urged him to stop using such profanity, but suggested that his speeches would not be as effective, which his crowds love to hear. Trump also engages in ludicrous and harmful rhetoric by claiming that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating the pets of the residents of that town. Trump seems to have special animus for migrants from poor, non-white majority countries which, he claims, are emptying their societies of criminals and mentally impaired people and sending them to the United States.\n\nTrump seems to have special animus for migrants from poor, non-white majority countries.\n\nFor her part, Harris has stated that she agrees with Trump’s former White House chief of staff, retired General John Kelly, that Trump fits the definition of a “fascist.” Even the democratic socialist US senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, has said he prefers not to use the word fascist when describing Trump. The derogatory labeling by Trump and Harris of each other is indicative of how nasty this close election has become.\n\nRepeat of the January 6 Attack Is Unlikely…\n\nBecause Biden will still be president on January 6, 2025, he will be in charge, as head of the executive branch, of providing the necessary security to protect the Capitol building in case Trump loses and his supporters again try to pressure lawmakers not to certify the electoral college results. Already, there have been practice drills of 12 helicopters landing on US Capitol grounds to boost security in case rioters attempt to storm the Capitol again. But because so many of the January 6 insurrectionists have been sentenced to jail, and knowing that they would face a formidable security presence this time around, Trump’s diehard supporters are unlikely to repeat their 2021 actions.\n\n…But Violence is Likely in Other Places\n\nNonetheless, emotions are so raw in this very tight presidential election (the polls suggest a dead heat, nearly all of which are within the margin of error) that if Trump loses, many of his supporters may claim that it was rigged and will demand “justice.” According to a January 2024 poll, about 66 percent of Trump supporters believed he won in 2020, implying that Biden is not a legitimate president. Teams of lawyers have been assembled by the Trump and Harris campaigns to report violations of the vote or to challenge the other side’s claims of fraud. In early August, the Republican-controlled state election board of Georgia adopted a rule that requires local election board members to conduct an undefined “reasonable inquiry” into any discrepancies before they can certify an election. The rule is so broad that the final election tally for the state could be held up for days.\n\nTrump has stirred up his base into believing that he would only lose if the other side cheats.\n\nIn addition to such legal maneuvers is Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric in which he claims that the only way he will lose the election is if it is fraudulent. In a prerecorded video that was shown every night of the 2024 Republican convention, Trump said,“ The most important thing we have to do is protect the vote. You have to keep your eyes open because these people [Democrats] want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it’s the only thing they do well.” Not surprisingly, even in the state of Virginia, which both Democrats and Republicans have won in recent years, only a little less than half of Trump supporters (48 percent) say they would be willing to accept a Harris presidency if she wins the election.\n\nTrump has stirred up his base into believing that he would only lose if the other side cheats, frequently using an undefined “they,” such as “they are coming after you.” Trump’s MAGA supporters could attack election poll workers, those involved in the counting of ballots, and state elections officials who would certify a Harris victory.\n\nIn addition, immigrants could be targeted, and not just those who have entered or stayed in the country illegally. During the presidential debate, Trump claimed without evidence that “our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote.” Trump’s previous comments about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the country as well as more recent comments that he (and his supporters) have made claiming falsely that funds for the victims of Hurricane Helene that severely affected the southern parts of Appalachia were being diverted to services for illegal immigrants may also encourage violence. In addition, because many minority group voters, like Black and Latino voters, may favor Harris over Trump, sporadic acts of violence directed at some of them could occur if Trump loses.\n\nWarnings by Biden and Experts on Extremism\n\nThe past October, when Biden was asked about the upcoming election, he said he was confident it would be free and fair but added, “I don’t know whether it’ll be peaceful.” This comment was partly political, reflecting his belief that Trump is ginning up his base to contest the election result if he loses to Harris. But it also may reflect briefings that the president has received from law enforcement agencies about the potential for violence.\n\nIndeed, experts who have been monitoring extremist groups ahead of the election, such as those from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), have highlighted a boost in online chatter that mirrored the situation in the run-up to the 2020 vote and the January 6 attack. In October, GPAHE noted that violent rhetoric related to election denialism has increased significantly on extremist online platforms.\n\nThere is boost in online chatter that mirrors the situation in the run-up to the 2020 vote and the January 6 attack.\n\nOn one such platform, Gab, users have threatened those alleged to have engaged in election fraud with treason, and called for “firing squads” or “the rope” to deal with them. Other extremist posts on Telegram have used election denialism to justify acts of violence, for example urging users to “shoot to kill any illegal voters.” Although organized extremist groups undoubtedly know that they are being monitored by law enforcement agencies, rhetoric on such platforms may inspire so-called lone wolves to commit individual acts of violence.\n\nAnd Worry by Ordinary Americans\n\nAccording to recent polling, about 57 percent of Americans in battleground states are very or somewhat worried that Trump supporters will turn to violence if he loses. These sentiments and threats have led to increased security for voters, election workers, and election infrastructure in these and other states. The Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, Mark Rozell, has said that these polling numbers underscore that “we cannot assume that people will accept the legitimacy of the election, and that a peaceful transfer of power is something that just automatically happens here.”\n\nThat indeed is a sad reflection of politics in the United States at present. It is hoped that government institutions will not only work to protect citizens in this highly charged atmosphere but also will be a hedge against dubious charges of fraud such as the claim that illegal immigrants are voting. But it will also take courageous individual public servants to stand their ground. Some of them did so last time, and the hope is that they will do so again. A presidential election marred by intimidation and violence will not only be a blight on America’s democracy at home but also will hurt its standing abroad.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Shutterstock/Sebastian Portillo",

        "position": 3,
        "content": "In a strategic move to reinforce its presence in the decentralized social networking landscape, MaskDAO has completed the acquisition of Orb.club, a rapidly growing Web3-native social platform. The integration aims to advance MaskDAO’s broader mission of fostering a more expressive, interconnected, and user-owned digital experience, as outlined by its parent entity, Mask Network.\n\nOrb.club, which has gained notable traction for its engaging features such as viral sticker campaigns, collectible content, and in-app tipping functionalities, reported more than 50,000 monthly active users by the beginning of 2025. With its unique take on social interaction, the platform has carved out a distinctive position within the Web3 social media domain. The recent acquisition is poised to boost MaskDAO’s ecosystem by leveraging Orb’s innovation and user engagement strategies.\n\nEnhancing a Diverse Decentralized Portfolio\n\nThe acquisition brings Orb.club into the fold of an already robust network of MaskDAO-managed projects, which includes initiatives such as Next.ID, Web3.bio, and Firefly.social. Observers expect the move to not only enhance MaskDAO’s existing offerings but also accelerate the development of a fully decentralized and user-centric social ecosystem. The organization sees the integration as a natural extension of its mission to provide alternative, ownership-driven online experiences.\n\nMask Network, the founding entity behind MaskDAO, has undergone a considerable transformation since its launch in 2017. Initially conceived as a browser extension bridging Web2 and Web3 services, it has since evolved into a significant player in decentralized social media. Industry insiders have referred to it as the “Tencent of Web3,” due to its ambitious scope and growing influence. Through the creation of shared digital infrastructure, investments in onchain applications, and initiatives aimed at promoting user autonomy, Mask Network has positioned itself as a central figure in the next-generation internet. The establishment of MaskDAO in early 2025 served to further decentralize governance and reinforce its expanding ecosystem.\n\nOrb.club’s Role in the Future of Social Interaction\n\nJoining the MaskDAO network is expected to provide Orb.club with access to advanced infrastructure and a broader user base. Known for its prioritization of self-expression, user ownership, and gamified engagement, the platform has introduced a novel approach to online social interactions. Its content-driven economy has empowered both creators and users to participate meaningfully while also reaping economic benefits from their contributions.\n\nIn the context of recent developments like the launch of the Lens Chain by the Avara team, Orb’s mobile application is expected to become a primary destination for discovering trending onchain content. One of Orb’s standout features, Orb Clubs, facilitates the creation of community-centric micro-networks that allow participants to earn through engagement rather than through traditional metrics like follower counts or token speculation. This model emphasizes meaningful connection and rewards user involvement with actual ownership stakes and incentives.\n\nStrategic Vision for the Future of Web3 Social\n\nSuji Yan, the founder of Mask Network and MaskDAO, expressed a forward-looking view on the acquisition, indicating that the inclusion of Orb would reinvigorate the concept of online community in the Web3 space. He emphasized that the platform’s focus on creator monetization and community-driven models had redefined how users find joy and purpose in online interactions. The acquisition is considered a pivotal step toward MaskDAO’s aspiration to become a comprehensive hub for decentralized applications spanning identity, content, and user interaction.\n\nThe alignment between MaskDAO’s long-term vision and Orb.club’s innovative approach to social engagement underscores a shared belief in the transformative potential of decentralized technologies. As the ecosystem continues to grow, industry stakeholders will likely monitor how this integration shapes the broader Web3 social media environment.",

        "content": "System dynamics evolutionary game modeling\n\nAt its core, the “driving force” for the evolution of gamers’ strategies is the Darwinian principle of natural selection. This means that strategies demonstrating a high level of fitness have the potential to spread within the population through processes such as imitation, learning, replication, or contagion at the individual level. On the contrary, strategies with a low fitness level are more likely to be eliminated by natural selection. As these strategies evolve within the population, they give rise to various long-term dynamical behaviors at the system level72. System Dynamics is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of complex systems, which enables us to learn about individual decisions from a wider system perspective73. By adopting this approach, we can gain more precise insights into the strategic choices made by each participant and depict their decision-making processes more accurately.\n\nBy using the replication dynamic equations of the local government and resettlers, as well as the correlation and dynamics between each subject’s strategy choices and their perceived benefit function, the previous part clarified the learning evolution mechanism. We use the VENSIM PLE 10.2.2 software to build a system dynamics (SD) model for the evolutionary game involving water conservancy project relocation and resettlement stakeholders in order to perform a more thorough analysis of the strategic interaction among the game subjects based on the game model mentioned above and the perceived benefit function of each subject. This SD model is built using the system flow diagram, which allows us to visually represent the intricate influences and feedback mechanisms between the game subjects74. This model is determined by a perceived benefit function containing two state variables: the local government’s positive implementation of the relocation and resettlement policy \\(a\\) and resettlers’ voluntary migration \\(b\\). There are two rate variables: the rate of change of the local government’s implementation efforts and the rate of change of resettlers’ willingness to migrate. The model includes four auxiliary variables, denoted as \\(V_{a1} ,V_{a2}\\) and \\(V_{b1} ,V_{b2}\\), and 15 external variables. The functions of state, rate, middle, and outer variables are represented by streamlines. In Fig. 7, the red and green flow lines represent the function of the state, the external variables, and the perceived benefit function related to the government’s active or passive policy. The yellow and blue flow lines show the relationship between the state variables, the external variables, and the perceived benefit functions associated with the resettlers. Finally, the black streamlines illustrate the functional relationship between the state, intermediate, and rate variables. These streamlines help elucidate the relationship between the state variables, intermediate variables, rate variables, and the perceived benefit function associated with resettlers’ voluntary or passive migration within the model.\n\nFig. 7 System dynamics model of the evolutionary game between local government and resettlers. Full size image\n\nNumerical simulation analysis\n\nThe study data for the numerical simulation modeling were obtained from the resettlement case report of the Qianping Reservoir. It is worth noting that some parameters in the analysis are abstract and challenging to obtain. However, the parameter setup should primarily reflect the relationship between variables without influencing the research findings. To ensure the rationality of the parameters, and while adhering to the inequalities outlined in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 above, according to the project data and the existing literature on the parameter assignment method75,76 for reference, and after the water conservancy project relocation and resettlement of experts in the consulting and correction, through the calculation of the perceived value, simplified set the initial parameter values of the model auxiliary variables in Table 6. Where the values are set for each coefficient of the PT-MA function according to the assignments in the literature66,77 : \\(U_{1} = 1.5\\),\\(U_{2} = 2\\),\\(\\varepsilon ,\\eta = 0.98\\),\\(\\kappa ,\\sigma = 0.88\\),\\(\\delta ,\\zeta = 2\\),\\(\\mu = 0.61\\),\\(\\vartheta = 0.69\\).\n\nTable 6 Initial setting values of model parameters. Full size table\n\nBased on the evolution results depicted in Fig. 8a under Scenario 1, it can be observed that the initial willingness of both parties is \\(a = 0.9,b = 0.9\\), which aligns with the determination of the evolutionarily stable strategy point in Table 4. This outcome is consistent with the analysis findings of Scenario 1. The stable state for both parties is achieved at \\(E_{a} (0,0)\\). Thus, in this parameter setting, increasing the initial willingness beyond this point will not lead to a stable state at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). In Scenario 2, when the initial willingness of both parties is \\(a = 0.1,b = 0.1\\), the evolution results of their strategy selection are displayed in Fig. 8b. It is evident that both parties reach a stable state at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). This outcome corresponds with the analysis results of Scenario 2, indicating that even a lower initial willingness can result in stabilization at \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\). Therefore, the subsequent study will continue with the parameter setting of Scenario 1. It will analyze the impact of external variables on the strategy choices of each subject and examine the changing trends by manipulating the probability of strategy choice and adjusting the parameter setting of external variables. This aim is to explore how to optimize the evolution results from Scenario 1 to resemble those of Scenario 2 through adjustments in external variables. This optimization is intended to enable decision-makers to attain the strategy choices of both parties, even with a lower initial willingness, thereby actively promote the operation of the work.\n\nFig. 8 Effect of different parameter assignments on strategy selection. Full size image\n\nThe control variable method is employed to solely modify the probability of the initial willingness of one subject to evolve, enabling observation of the impact on the other subject. As illustrated in Fig. 9(a), by setting \\(a,b = \\{ (0.9,0.1),(0.5,0.1)\\}\\), when the probability of the local government’s inclination towards positive implementation progressively increases, the number of iterations required for the strategic choice of resettlers to reach the evolutionary steady state also increases. This leads to a slower evolutionary process. However, both parties ultimately tend to adopt a negative strategic choice regarding expropriation and resettlement, which only shortens the rate of their reaching the steady state. Conversely, adjusting the probability of voluntary migration of resettlers, as depicted in Fig. 9(b) with the setting \\(a,b = \\{ (0.1,0.9),(0.1,0.5)\\}\\) , has the minimal effect on the rate of change in the strategic choices of the local government. It also fails to create a distinction in their strategic choices. The basic tenet of evolutionary games dictates this: rather than using the initial ratio, the main body’s strategy will be selected or removed based on its success and profit42.\n\nFig. 9 Effect of different initial probabilities on strategy selection. Full size image\n\nNumerical sensitivity analysis\n\nThe analyses of scenarios 1 and 2 reveal that the value of each variable or parameter in the system dynamics determines the steady state reached by the system. In the following exploration, the impact of modifying the values of the more sensitive variables on the strategy choices of each subject is examined using the state variable \\(a = 0.5,b = 0.5\\) of both parties as an example.\n\nImpact of negative implementation policy cost\n\nThe influence of changes in the cost associated with passive implementation of policies by the local government \\(C_{3} ,C_{4}\\) on the subject’s evolutionary behavior is investigated. Let \\(C_{3} ,C_{4} = \\{ (1.4,1.6),(1.2,1.4),(1.0,1.2),(0.8,1.0)\\}\\), the evolutionary results for the local government are shown in Fig. 10a, where the greater the cost of negative implementation, the more the local government tends to favour the strategic choice of actively implementing the policy. The gradual increase in costs makes the relative attractiveness of negative implementation policies decrease. In parallel, when the local government adopts a positive policy of implementation, they are able to obtain more financial support (compensation fees, investment in resource development, etc.) from higher levels of government and promote long-term gains from social and economic stability. Therefore, the local government are more inclined to adopt an active implementation strategy to maximise their long-term benefits. Figure 10b shows the strategic choices of resettlers in the same situation, which has little impact on resettlers. This is due to the fact that although the behaviour of the local government affects the migration compensation and resettlement conditions, the resettlers are faced with the perception of risk, fairness of compensation and improvement or deterioration of the living environment, and then still makes decisions based on their own risk-tolerance and expectations of their future lives.\n\nFig. 10 Simulation results for the change in negative implementation policy cost. Full size image\n\nImpact of incentives and disincentives\n\nThe impact of modifying the rewards for due diligence positive implementation \\(S_{2}\\) and the penalties for dereliction of duty passive implementation \\(T_{2}\\) by the local government on the evolutionary behavior of the local government. The simulation results for \\(S_{2} = \\{ 1.4,1.1,0.8,0.5\\}\\) are depicted in Fig. 11a. As the due diligence reward increases, the local government tends to slow down the rate of the passive implementation. When \\(S_{2} = 1.4\\), the strategy choice shifts from passive implementation to positive implementation. Rewards enable the local government to gain more political capital, economic benefits and social recognition from them, and it directly affects the local government’s goal of maximising revenue, and also reflects the recognition of the local government’s work by higher levels of government, which increases the motivation of the local government to implement policies. Setting \\(T_{2} = \\{ 1.7,1.4,1.1,0.8\\}\\), the evolutionary outcomes shown in Fig. 11b exhibit a similarity to the results in Fig. 11a. Punishment makes the local government have a clear expectation of the cost of negative implementation policies, and thus tend to choose positive implementation policies to avoid punishment as much as possible. Therefore, the higher-level government can set up a corresponding reward and punishment system, so that the two complement each other, effectively incentivising the local government to adopt a positive implementation strategy in the implementation of water conservancy project relocation and resettlement process, thus reducing the possibility of social stability risks.\n\nFig. 11 Simulation results of the impact of changes in \\(S_{2} ,T_{2}\\) on the local government. Full size image\n\nImpact of psychological perceived value\n\nThe influence of psychological perceived value \\(U_{1} ,U_{2}\\) on the evolution of subjects is examined by evolving \\(U_{1} = \\{ 2.0,1.5,1.0,0.5\\}\\) and subsequently modifying \\(U_{2} = \\{ 2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0\\}\\). The simulation results for the local government and resettlers are presented in Fig. 12. As the reference value of the payment account \\(U_{1}\\) decreases, the local government transitions from a passive policy implementation approach to an active one. Meanwhile, the rate at which resettlers converge towards involuntary migration slows down, but does not alter their strategy choices. As the reference value of the gain account \\(U_{2}\\) decreases, the local government gradually converges towards 1, reaching a stable state, and resettlers shift their attitude from involuntary migration to voluntary migration. This suggests that resettlers usually feel a strong sense of anxiety and unease when faced with evictions because they not only lose their homes but also face an uncertain future. Resettlers’ anxiety and homeland attachment complexes are more complex, making them more resistant to changing the status quo. Therefore, resettlers’ strategic choices do not only depend on the local government’s compensation payments, but also include psychological expectations about quality of life and social identity, which largely determine whether they change from involuntary to voluntary migration. The local government, when implementing the policy, not only has to pay financial compensation, but also has to bear the time, energy and emotional costs of management and coordination. Changes in the reference values of the payment account and the benefit account will have a significant effect on the local government, though, as the seamless execution of the relocation and resettlement work and the enhancement of the resettlers’ life satisfaction will also increase the happiness of the local government.\n\nFig. 12 Simulation results for the variation of \\(U_{1} ,U_{2}\\). Full size image\n\nImpact of the risk of passive participation of resettlers\n\nIn situations where resettlers’ participation is involuntary, the local government is compelled to address issues related to social disorder and value perception \\(T_{3}\\) through measures such as price increases. During this period, resettlers are required to bear the additional risk \\(T_{4}\\) associated with the evolution of the subject. Let \\(T_{3} = \\{ 2.0,1.6,1.2,0.8\\}\\), the results of the evolution are depicted in Fig. 13a. As the local government raises prices to a greater extent, resettlers exhibit an increased desire to benefit from the system, resulting in a faster rate of convergence towards a stable state under passive participation. The strategy choice of the local government is minimally affected, suggesting that the monetary investment required to mitigate social disorder through measures like price increases is not a primary factor driving their decision towards active implementation. Moreover, when setting \\(T_{4} = \\{ 1.5,1.1,0.7,0.3\\}\\), the evolutionary outcomes are shown in Fig. 13b. The risks that resettlers have to bear when they migrate passively include, not only the safety of their lives and property, but also the uncertainty of their social identity in the midst of chaos, competition for social resources and an unfavourable external environment. Although the choice of voluntary migration may imply stress and discomfort in the short term, in the long term, the strategic choice of resettlers will shift from the previous involuntary migration to voluntary migration when resettlers realise that they can obtain better economic and social compensation and reduce the risk of social conflict and personal security through voluntary migration.\n\nFig. 13 Simulation results for the variation of \\(T_{3} ,T_{4}\\). Full size image\n\nImpact of synergistic gains and distribution ratio\n\nThe impact of changes in additional synergistic gains on social order stability during the migration process \\(S_{4}\\) and its distribution ratio \\(\\rho\\) on the evolutionary behavior of subjects. Initially, we only considered changes to \\(S_{4} = \\{ 3.0,2.2,1.4,0.6\\}\\).The simulation results of the local government and resettlers are shown in Fig. 14a. Synergistic gains are expressed as mutual benefits such as social stability, economic development and environmental improvement achieved through cooperation. When the construction of water conservancy projects is completed to effectively prevent floods and improve irrigation, both the local government and migrant groups will benefit. This leads to more active implementation of resettlement programmes by the local government and more willingness of migrant groups to migrate voluntarily. Next, we take \\(S_{4} = 3.0\\), set \\(\\rho = \\{ 0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8\\}\\). It is known that when the allocation ratio increases, i.e., the local government has a large gain, and vice versa, i.e., the migrant population has a large gain, and the evolution process is shown in Fig. 14b. The proportion of gains directly affects the distribution of gains between the two parties, which in turn affects their behaviour. When the local government has a larger gain, it is more motivated to promote migration, but the voluntary participation of migrants is lower; on the contrary, when the gain of migrants is larger, migrants are more willing to migrate voluntarily, but the local government may lack sufficient incentives, which leads to a lower motivation for implementation. The benefits to migrants can be appropriately increased in the early stages of migration to incentivise their active participation in migration. As the migration programme progresses, the distribution of benefits between the Government and migrants can be gradually adjusted so that the interests of both parties continue to be balanced.\n\nFig. 14 Simulation results for the variation of \\(S_{4} ,\\rho\\). Full size image\n\nAnalysis of the system feedback structure\n\nSystem dynamics posits that a system’s behavioral patterns are influenced by the information feedback mechanism operating within the system. The analysis of the feedback mechanism between the local government and resettlers, and the simulation results provides insights into the system-subject feedback relationship. Figure 15 illustrates this relationship, combining the findings from the simulation analysis.\n\nFig. 15 Feedback mechanism between game subjects. Full size image\n\nThroughout the process of evolution, a mutually reinforcing cycle emerges between the local government’s “active implementation” and resettlers’ “voluntary participation”\\(D\\). This means that if the local government takes proactive measures such as implementing expropriation and resettlement policies, increasing compensation and resettlement benefits for resettlers, and effectively publicizing these plans to them, while also enhancing their living standards through infrastructure development in the resettlement area, the trust of resettlers has in the local government will grow. Consequently, when the local government actively implements expropriation and resettlement policies, offers enhanced compensation and resettlement benefits, conducts effective propaganda to ensure resettlers fully understand the policies, and improves their living standards through infrastructure development, it results in a higher-level of trust in the local government among resettlers, which subsequently increases their willingness to participate voluntarily in expropriation and resettlement. Even though the local government could potentially save money by passively implementing policies when migrant participation is voluntary, it instead chooses to implement them actively. This approach positively contributes to social stability and economic development within the locality. Moreover, it enhances the trust of both resettlers and the community in the local government, leading to intangible benefits. Consequently, the local government becomes more inclined to implement policies and willingly participate in resettlement work actively. This inclination creates a positive feedback mechanism between the local government and resettlers, reinforcing and promoting each other. The evolutionary equilibrium solution \\(E_{d} (1,1)\\) reflects the mutual promotion between the two components. Specifically, the probability of the local government actively implementing policies and the probability of resettlers voluntarily participating converge towards \"1\" in the same direction.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the positive feedback mechanism within the system can also lead to a mutually reinforcing phenomenon. In other words, if the local government fails to adequately plan and prepare for requisition and relocation work, slows down the implementation of relevant compensation policies, it will result in delays in compensation for resettlers. As a result, they will be unable to reach the satisfaction level expected by resettlers who have taken on the risk of cooperating with the work. Inevitably, this will lead to protests among the passive migrants. This is a highly probable outcome during the implementation of numerous water conservancy projects involving requisition and relocation, and represents one of the significant reasons contributing to psychological resistance among resettlers. On the other hand, when resettlers are passively involved in the work, the local government considers the additional costs associated with suspending the work or selecting an alternative site. Additionally, there are expenses related to maintaining social stability through price increases. Consequently, the local government may opt to passively implement the policy to save funds. In this scenario, positive feedback exists between the local government and resettlers. The evolutionary equilibrium solution \\(E_{a} (0,0)\\) aligns with this situation, indicating that the probability of the local government positively implementing the policy and the likelihood of migrants voluntarily participating in the work both converge towards \"0\" in the same direction.",

        "content": "Plenty of studies, some of them published by the Arts Endowment, have shown how arts participation in early childhood appears to awaken greater social skills and behaviors at a crucial stage of development. It’s no surprise, especially among infants and toddlers, that most arts activities involve a parent or caregiver.\n\nIt stands to reason, therefore, that parents’ own preferences or backgrounds, their beliefs about the arts, and even their overall attitudes toward social engagement, might play a role in determining whether the parents involve their children in the arts, and—for that matter—whether their children experience positive outcomes associated with these activities.\n\nIn the peer-reviewed journal Infancy, a new article, titled “Parental Social and Musical Characteristics, the Home Music Environment, and Child Language Development in Infancy,” pursues these very questions. Authored by Ashley Boyne, Camila Alviar, and Miriam Lense—and supported in part by a NEA Research Lab award to Vanderbilt University Medical Center—the study tracks 43 caregiver/infant pairings (i.e., dyads) over a year and a half.\n\nThroughout this period, the researchers examined whether parents who enjoy other social activities were more likely than other parents to cultivate a “home music environment,” and whether they were more likely to sing and even more likely to report believing in the positive impacts of music for their children. By way of comparison, Boyne and colleagues also investigated whether parents’ levels of musical training predicted their home music environment, their likelihood of singing, and their beliefs about music.\n\nThe researchers then sought to understand whether this constellation of parental and household factors, in turn, predicted language development among infants. On this topic , the article cites an extensive body of literature, preeminently from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, showing how auditory processing of musical rhythms, and interpretation of audiovisual cues, can assist with language growth and expressive communication skills.\n\nAt various time points throughout the study, researchers administered a series of surveys to the parents/caregivers. The questionnaires separately gauged the home music environment of the parents (e.g., the degree of parent-child interaction around music-making, and the degree of the child’s active engagement with music), the parents’ extent of musical training, the parents’ beliefs about music (e.g., whether it “has an impact on [the] child’s intelligence”), and their self-reported levels of social competence. A separate inventory tool asked each parent to report, via checklist, how many and what types of words their infants spoke, words they understood, and gestures they made.\n\nAnalyses showed that social motivation was positively correlated with the home music environment—specifically, with parent beliefs in the power of music, and with parents singing to their infants. As for parents’ formal musical training, this variable was related solely to parents’ beliefs about music. It did not correlate with parent-child musical interactions. Thus, “parent social motivation was a stronger predictor of the home music environment than musical training,” the researchers write.\n\nBut what difference do parents’ musical habits and beliefs make in contributing to language development among infants? The study found that “the overall home music environment and specifically, parent singing, positively correlated with child language development across 9–18 months of age when considering multiple domains of language: vocabulary comprehension, vocabulary production, and gesture production,” the article states.\n\n“In contrast, we found no association between (parent-reported) parent beliefs and child language development,” the authors add.\n\nTo Boyne et al., the overall findings’ implications are plain. “Musical interactions provide a positive, highly social, and, in the case of singing, linguistically rich experience,” they write. “It is through these types of social interactive contexts that children learn and advance their communicative skills. The connection between parents' self-reported active singing behaviors with their infant and infant language and gesture development”—for example, in nursery rhyme singalongs—\"also highlights the embedded nature of infant learning, where children's skills are developed by interacting with their everyday environments.”\n\nFor all that, “it requires more than parents' belief in music for music to impact their child's development; parents must actively take steps to create this musical environment,” as the study demonstrates. “Enriching musical engagement with infants is likely more about the positive and interactive social experience rather than highly skilled musical experiences,” i.e., the parents’ level of musical training.\n\nIn other words, to quote Hamlet, the readiness is all. Parents who might give a second thought about their lack of musical training or experience: don’t hesitate! Sing to your babies. But then, if you consider yourself socially active, you probably are doing this already.\n\nSunil Iyengar directs the NEA Office of Research & Analysis.",

        "content": "Elon Musk announced on Friday that xAI, his AI startup, had acquired X, his social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in an all-stock transaction combining two of Musk's highest-profile companies.\n\nIn a post on X, Musk wrote that the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, giving the two companies a total value of $113 billion. The new joint entity will be known as XAI Holdings, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe goal of the acquisition is to build a social media site with advanced AI features. In other words, Musk claimed that xAI's acquisition of X will allow xAI to bring advanced \"smarter, more meaningful\" AI experiences to X's more than 600 million active users.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk's Newest AI Chatbot Outperformed ChatGPT in One Key Area\n\n\"xAI and X's futures are intertwined,\" Musk wrote in the X post, which has garnered more than 55 million views. \"Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.\"\n\n@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).\n\n\n\nSince its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025\n\nxAI and X have been slowly integrating for years. According to Bloomberg, xAI has reportedly used data from X to develop its flagship product, an AI chatbot named Grok that sets itself apart from competitors like ChatGPT and Gemini by incorporating sarcasm and humor. Premium X users were the first to access Grok on X in December 2023.\n\nX and xAI are both private companies, so no details of the deal were made public except for Musk's post.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk Releases the AI Model Behind Grok, a Competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nX is an established social media company with over 2,000 employees and an expected U.S. ad revenue of $1.31 billion this year, a 17.5% yearly increase. Musk bought the company, then called Twitter, for $44 billion in October 2022. Since then, Twitter has rebranded to X, implemented cost cuts, and added new features, including a subscription service.\n\nMusk founded xAI in March 2023 to understand the universe, the company's website says. The AI startup raised $6 billion in December and unveiled Grok 3 last month.\n\nGrok is available on web browsers and mobile devices, but it is also integrated into the X platform. X users can use Grok to ask questions, brainstorm, and solve problems by visiting x.com or the X app on iOS or Android and clicking the Grok icon in the navigation bar.",

        "content": "President Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office on Friday after Mr. Musk announced his departure from his role as a special government employee.\n\nElon Musk lashed out on Tuesday against the far-reaching Republican bill intended to enact President Trump’s domestic policy agenda, posting on X that it was a “disgusting abomination” and telling House members who voted for it: “You know you did wrong.”\n\nThe tech billionaire criticized the bill, one of Mr. Trump’s top priorities, in a series of about 10 posts. In them, Mr. Musk reshared commentary from lawmakers like Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, two Republicans who had sided with him in opposing the rising U.S. deficit.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Mr. Musk wrote on X. He called the domestic policy bill “massive, outrageous, pork-filled,” adding that it would “massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit” and that “Congress is making America bankrupt.”\n\nHe did not target any specific members of Congress, but hinted that he might support efforts to unseat those who backed the bill in the 2026 midterm elections. “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote.\n\nThe blitz of messages signaled a widening rift between Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump as the tech mogul winds down his governmental role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. While the men have publicly professed continued admiration for each other, Mr. Musk’s departure from Washington has appeared to liberate him from presenting a united front with the White House.\n\nInstead, he has returned to wielding his brand of unpredictable political influence through X, the social media platform he owns. In December, before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Musk torpedoed a bipartisan spending bill with an onslaught of posts on X, including a threat to find primary challengers for Republicans who supported it. In March, he tried unsuccessfully to sway the outcome of a Wisconsin judicial race with myriad posts in favor of the conservative candidate.\n\nNow unshackled from loyalty to the Trump party line, Mr. Musk can again foment chaos with his X feed.\n\nMr. Musk, 53, has often criticized legislation, agencies and others that are against the interests of himself and his companies, which include the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. In its current form, Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill would end subsidies and tax credits meant to spur consumers to buy electric vehicles, which would have ramifications for Tesla.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, called Mr. Musk’s criticism of the domestic policy bill “very disappointing.” He told reporters at the Capitol that the two spoke on Monday and that Mr. Musk “seemed to understand” the virtues of the legislation.\n\nThe White House and the president were caught off guard by Mr. Musk’s posts, a person with knowledge of the situation said, but it’s not yet clear whether Mr. Trump will return fire.\n\n“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”\n\nA representative for Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Trump has urged swift passage of the legislation — officially called the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — which would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement. As written, the legislation would cut health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.\n\nWhite House officials and Mr. Johnson have claimed that the bill would shrink the national debt, although the Congressional Budget Office and a number of independent analysts have estimated that the bill would increase federal deficits by well over $1 trillion, even when economic growth is factored in.\n\nMr. Musk posted his criticism at a critical moment for the bill, which passed the House on May 22 in the face of a strong pressure campaign by Mr. Trump. As Mr. Johnson corralled several competing Republican factions, the president summoned recalcitrant holdouts to the White House, and his staff likened Republican opposition to the bill to “the ultimate betrayal.”\n\nBut Republican senators have already made clear that they plan to make changes to the bill. Fiscal conservatives, alarmed at the estimates that it would swell the national debt, have demanded further changes and cuts to Medicaid and other programs that could help rein in deficits. Mr. Trump has warned Republicans not to mess with Medicaid, a program that many of his supporters rely on.\n\nMr. Musk started publicly criticizing Mr. Trump’s bill last week, saying on CBS News’s “Sunday Morning” that he was disappointed in the legislation’s size and impact on the deficit.\n\nPeople close to the congressional negotiations said Mr. Musk was disappointed that Republicans were removing electric vehicle subsidies, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.\n\n“I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that,” Mr. Johnson said. But he added that he did not believe the government should be subsidizing a transition to electric cars.\n\nIn an earlier public break with the administration, Mr. Musk slammed the president’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, as a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a series of X posts in April. Tesla executives said Mr. Musk, who abstained from criticizing Mr. Trump directly, seemed not to immediately realize the impact that the administration’s tariffs could have on the automaker.\n\nThe White House downplayed the conflict at the time. Asked about it then, Ms. Leavitt said, “Boys will be boys.” Late that month, Mr. Musk was briefed on the tariffs’ effects and the company’s supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nMr. Musk’s threats about unseating Republicans contrast with his political spending last year. His super PAC, America PAC, spent about $20 million in the last election cycle to boost Republicans running for the House. And a different PAC he backed spent $10 million to help Republicans in the Senate.\n\nSome Democrats celebrated Mr. Musk’s criticism. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, brought a printed-out copy of Mr. Musk’s X posts to the party’s weekly news conference on Tuesday.\n\n“He’s right,” Mr. Schumer said. “Republicans should listen to him.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr. Musk — who appeared onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February with a chain saw and said it would be “easy” to save the government billions of dollars — shared a meme on X that included a photo of fingertips pinching a minuscule pair of scissors.\n\n“Republicans getting ready to reduce the size of government,” the caption read.\n\nShawn McCreesh , Theodore Schleifer and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.",

        "content": "A Republican congressman is broadening an investigation into the extent of former President Joe Biden's physical and mental decline while in office, seeking testimony from some of Biden's closest advisers, including his first chief of staff.\n\nGOP Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, chairman of the House Oversight committee, sent letters to five of the former president's closest aides on Wednesday, requesting they answer questions about Biden's \"mental and physical faculties\" while he was leading the country.\n\nThe aides include Biden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, as well as members of his inner circle — advisers Michael Donilon, Bruce Reed, Steve Richetti, and Anita Dunn.\n\nA spokesperson told CBS News the committee is already in discussions with four other former White House aides — Anthony Bernal, Annie Tomasini, Ashley Williams, and Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor — to provide testimony.\n\nScrutiny of Biden's health while in office has intensified over recent weeks following the revelation by the 82-year-old that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, and a new book that claims officials within the Biden White House worked to hide a \"precipitous decline\" in his physical and mental health while in office.\n\nKlain, who left the White House in February 2023 and also helped prepare Biden ahead of a disastrous debate performance last June, has pushed back on accusations that he covered up any health issues. In a text message to Politico, he instead attributed Biden's poor performance to advisers, who had \"isolated him from domestic politics.\"\n\nIn the letters he sent Wednesday, Comer requested the aides appear before the committee for transcribed interviews in the middle of July.\n\n\"If White House staff carried out a strategy lasting months or even years to hide the chief executive's condition–or to perform his duties–Congress may need to consider a legislative response,\" the Kentucky Republican wrote.\n\nAs chair of the House Oversight committee, Comer oversaw a long-running investigation trying to connect President Biden to the business dealings of his son Hunter. That investigation culminated in an impeachment inquiry that eventually stalled out before coming to a vote.",

        "content": "Donald Trump’s preoccupation with Joe Biden has appeared unhealthy for quite some time. On Memorial Day, for example, the Republican president promoted an online item that described his Democratic predecessor, who had recently been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, as “a decrepit corpse.”\n\nOn Friday, the incumbent went further, urging people not to feel sympathy for Biden as he combats cancer — “because he’s vicious.” His claim was rooted in the absurd Republican conspiracy theory that Biden personally executed a secret plot that culminated in Trump’s 2023 criminal indictments.\n\nBut as it turns out, the day after the Republican president made these public comments at an Oval Office event, Trump apparently took an interest in an even more unhinged conspiracy theory. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday night reposted a baseless claim on Truth Social that former President Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced with clones or robots. The original post, made by an anonymous Truth Social user who often spreads outlandish claims, suggested that Biden was replaced with “clones, doubles” and “robotic engineered soulless mindless entities.”\n\nPeriodically, the political world ponders a parlor game of sorts, based on an unfortunate question: “What’s the most bananas idea Donald Trump has ever endorsed, promoted or amplified?” The competition has long been fierce.\n\nIndeed, just in recent weeks, the current president has used his social media platform to amplify all kinds of truly bizarre claims and arguments, ranging from targeting Barack Obama with a military tribunal, accusing federal judges of committing acts “tantamount to treason and sedition,” to suggestions that Trump should be chosen to serve as the pope.\n\nBut for those who partake in this little parlor game, there’s clearly a new frontrunner.\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump used his social media platform to amplify an item that claimed that Biden was secretly “executed in 2020,” at which point the public saw “clones,” “doubles” and “robotic engineered soulless mindless entities” that appeared to be the Delaware Democrat.\n\nTo be sure, the Republican didn’t personally write this message, but he nevertheless thought it’d be a good idea to amplify the missive, bringing it to the attention of his millions of online followers.\n\nAs for why in the world Trump did this, The New York Times reported, “The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the post about Mr. Biden, whom Mr. Trump has targeted for criticism almost daily since the start of his second term.”\n\nWhether the incumbent president realizes this or not, he’s gradually discrediting his own weird campaign against his predecessor. In recent weeks, fueled in part by the book “Original Sin” by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Trump has argued — publicly and in apparent seriousness — that the entire Biden administration was “illegal,” because the Democrat was so incapacitated that his presidency was reduced to “autopen.”\n\nBut if the goal is to reinforce concerns about Biden’s mental health and acuity, Trump has it backwards.\n\nConsider what this story would look like if their situations were reversed. Imagine Biden were in the White House right now, and he decided to use his social media account to amplify a message that accused Trump of being dead and replaced by robotic clones.\n\nI suspect that if the Democrat were to do this, there would be widespread concern that the president had gone completely around the bend. And yet, here we are.\n\nFor those concerned about elderly presidents and their cognitive abilities, there’s one key truth that shouldn’t get lost in the shuffle: Biden isn’t the one amplifying a message about his former rival secretly being a dead robot.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is expected to interview former Hunter Biden special counsel David Weiss behind closed doors on Friday, two sources familiar with the interview told CNN, as part of a broader Republican effort to revisit previous probes into the Biden family that stalled last Congress but are gaining new momentum now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe scheduled interview, which could still be moved, would be the second time the Republican-led panel will interview Weiss about his work as Republicans continue to probe whether the investigation was hampered by political interference.\n\nWeiss has still never testified publicly about his six-year criminal probe into the president’s son, which included three convictions, but was ultimately short-circuited as a result of the former president’s unconditional pardon of his son.\n\nHouse Judiciary Republicans have long wanted to call Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney, back for questioning after his first closed-door interview in 2023. Committee Republicans were also able to finally secure interviews with two Department of Justice tax division prosecutors involved in the Hunter Biden probe who they had been aggressively pursuing for months, one of the sources familiar told CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department is working with Weiss to provide access to documents he may need for his interview, a person briefed on the matter said. Any delays in getting access to documents would be a scheduling issue and the ability to have personnel who can oversee it, the person briefed on the matter said.\n\nIt’s not the only Biden investigation Republicans are reexamining that leans into a fresh political appetite with GOP control of Washington.\n\nHouse Oversight Chair James Comer is returning to his probe of the former president’s mental fitness in an entirely new landscape after a recent book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson put Joe Biden’s physical and mental decline back in the spotlight.\n\nComer told CNN he is in the process of scheduling key interviews with Biden’s White House physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, and other senior aides who had all rebuffed his efforts last Congress. Beyond the five initial interviews from Biden’s orbit, the Republican Chairman told CNN he wants to look at the executive orders Biden signed in his last six months in office and use of the autopen.\n\nIn the weeks immediately after Biden’s disastrous 2024 debate performance that unraveled his presidential campaign and upended the Democratic party, Comer requested to interview Biden’s doctor and subpoenaed three senior Biden aides to discuss their roles in the Biden White House, which never materialized.\n\nNow, Comer said in an interview with CNN, “it is a whole different environment.”\n\nAt the time of his 2024 interview requests, Comer’s impeachment inquiry into the Biden family’s business dealings had fallen apart and the Biden administration felt no incentive to comply with the House Oversight Committee.\n\nProbing Biden’s decline now, Comer says, will be a lot easier than trying to convince his colleagues of an alleged Biden family foreign influence peddling scheme, which even Comer conceded was difficult to do, particularly in a minute or less on Fox News. Republicans failed to uncover evidence to support their core allegations against the president, and lacked the votes in their divided, narrow majority last Congress to impeach the president.\n\n“The money laundering and the shell companies, the average American couldn’t understand that. I mean, that was hard to understand,” Comer told CNN. “You know, I did not do a good job explaining that.”\n\nBut with his investigation into Biden’s mental and physical decline, Comer said, “people see a president that clearly is in decline. They saw it in the debate.”\n\nDemocrats sought to dismantle the Republican-led 11 month impeachment inquiry into Biden last Congress at every turn.\n\nComer told CNN that although those Democrats aren’t jumping at the opportunity to cooperate now, he does not see them as being obstructive either.\n\n“I take that as a step in the right direction,” he told CNN.\n\nTapper and Thompson’s book documents how Biden, his closest aides and his family forged ahead with the former president’s doomed 2024 reelection bid despite signs of his physical and mental decline.\n\nIn a previous statement to CNN, a Biden spokesman criticized the book, saying that evidence shows that “he was a very effective president.”\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips, who launched a long-shot challenge to Biden and was outspoken about his concerns over the former president’s age, told CNN he did not think there needed to be an investigation on Capitol Hill at this point into Biden’s fitness as president.\n\n“This case already went to trial, the jury of American voters convicted the party of the accused, and handed out the harshest political punishment possible-losing the single most consequential election in modern history,” Phillips told CNN.\n\nInstead, Phillips called on Biden to authorize his physician to disclose his health file and condition under oath.\n\n“Only if the former president refuses, or if questioning uncovers possible criminal activity, should an investigation be initiated,” Phillips added.\n\nBiden was recently diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Documents released by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday appear to contradict former FBI Director Christopher Wray’s claim that a controversial 2023 memo targeting “radical traditionalist Catholics” was a one-off and the work of a single bureau field office.\n\nExtent of FBI’s targeting of ‘radical traditionalist Catholics’ greater than Biden officials claimed, GOP senator reveals\n\nThe Biden-era FBI chief told House lawmakers in July of 2023 that the memo – which described the purported overlaps between Catholics who oppose abortion rights and would-be terrorists as an opportunity for “threat mitigation” and “source development” – was “a single product by a single field office.”\n\nHowever, the new FBI files obtained by Grassley show the bureau produced “at least 13 additional documents and five attachments that used anti-Catholic terminology,” as well as a second memo updating the FBI’s Richmond Field Office’s case against “radical” Catholics.\n\n4 FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies before the House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, DC, on July 12, 2023. ZUMAPRESS.com\n\n“Director Wray’s testimony was inaccurate not only because it failed to reveal the scope of the memo’s production and dissemination, but also because it failed to reveal the existence of a second, draft product on the same topic intended for external distribution to the whole FBI,” Grassley wrote in a letter to current FBI Director Kash Patel on Monday, demanding more documents.\n\nThe second FBI memo, released by Grassley, was also drafted by the FBI’s Richmond office and repeated the “unfounded link between traditional Catholicism and violent extremism.”\n\nThe backlash over the whistleblower disclosure of the initial memo led the Richmond office to never release the second version, according to the Iowa Republican.\n\nHowever, the first “anti-Catholic Richmond Memo” was “widely distributed” in February 2023 to more than 1,000 FBI employees nationwide, according to Grassley’s findings.\n\n“This raises serious concerns that FBI field offices may have relied on the Richmond memo, and placed groups in their areas of responsibility under suspicion based on reporting from the deeply-biased sources used in the memo,” the senator informed Patel.\n\nAdditionally, the new documents reveal that Richmond FBI officials worked with the bureau’s field offices in Louisville, Portland, and Milwaukee as they drafted the memo – further belying Wray’s testimony.\n\n4 The memo described the purported overlaps between Catholics who oppose abortion rights and would-be terrorists as an opportunity for “threat mitigation” and “source development.” mariangarai – stock.adobe.com\n\n4 President Joe Biden delivers his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 15, 2025.

        "content": "The jet engine technology that powers airplanes comes mostly from U.S. companies, but the engines can’t function without rare earth minerals that are manufactured largely in China.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade conflict is quickly morphing into a fight over global supply chains, as the two nations limit the sharing of critical technologies that could have lasting consequences for scores of industries.\n\nThe United States last week suspended some sales to China of components and software used in jet engines and semiconductors, a response to a clampdown by Beijing on the export of minerals used in large sectors of manufacturing. Both sides over the last few days have accused the other of operating in bad faith.\n\nThe supply chain warfare, which comes on top of tariffs the two countries have inflicted on the other’s imports, has alarmed companies that say they cannot make their products without components sourced from both. And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States, including pharmaceuticals or shipping.\n\n“The supply chain wars that we’ve been speculating about for years are now happening,” said Liza Tobin, a former White House national security adviser who is now the managing director at Garnaut Global, a risk advisory firm.\n\nIn recent weeks, the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon, and a victim, in this fight.\n\nThe jet engine technology that powers airplanes, and the navigation systems that control them, largely come from the United States, developed by companies like General Electric. In China’s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing, for example, it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.\n\nBut a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures, as well as other uses.\n\nBeijing restricted exports of those minerals, known as rare earths, in April after President Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States — including the work done by many defense contractors. In May, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.\n\nThe United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week, U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China, as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors, people familiar with the move say.\n\nAt the same time, officials in the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths, including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nBut any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average, it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine, according to statistics from S&P.\n\nThe Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers, as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other’s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term, many American companies established factories in countries outside of China, including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nEven so, the economies remain deeply integrated, an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons, doing so will be expensive and painful.\n\nSince 2022, for example, the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.\n\nThe United States has extended these export controls around the world, even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts, technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules, many have fallen in line.\n\nImage The U.S. and Chinese economies remain deeply integrated, with hundreds of billions of dollars of trade flowing across the Pacific each year. Credit... The New York Times\n\nThis system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China, rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.\n\nBeijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths, and magnets made from them, to companies worldwide. When Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145 percent in April, Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths, including pausing many of them.\n\nIn May, American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China, and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China’s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.\n\nNegotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal, China said it would “suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April,” according to a joint statement.\n\nU.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday, Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, said that the Chinese were “slow-rolling their compliance” and that American officials “haven’t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nMr. Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, he wrote that China had “TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” adding, “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday, saying that China had “earnestly implemented” the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal, including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei, the Chinese technology firm, anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.\n\n“The U.S., without any factual basis, has smeared and accused China, imposed export controls on chips, suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas — extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China’s legitimate rights and interests,” Mr. Lin said.\n\nWhile some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments, the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.\n\nThe tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States’ diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Communist Party.\n\nSo far, it is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had “no information to offer” on the call.\n\nDaniel H. Rosen, the co-founder of Rhodium Group, a research company, said that Beijing recognized years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidized the build-out of those supplies. The United States, he added, “horribly underestimated” the demand for them.\n\nChina mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, but it does the chemical processing for 90 percent of them. The country also makes more than 80 percent of the world’s batteries, more than 70 percent of its electric cars, and about half of the world’s steel, iron and aluminum, according to data from the International Energy Agency.\n\nSecuring an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, Mr. Rosen said, and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside of China.\n\n“It’s going to be expensive,” he said. “We have a long way to go.”\n\nWhile some shipments of minerals have restarted, many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo, a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group, said the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April, when Mr. Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.\n\nMr. Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue, as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.\n\n“This problem is deep and long lasting,” he said. “It will not go away, or be easily solved.”\n\nChris Buckley , Keith Bradsher and Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting and research.",

        "content": "Let me cut to the chase. Even if there were a “cover up” of the previous president’s infirmity, that’s not why Donald Trump won.\n\nYet that is the allegation hiding in the subtext of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book. The sin in Original Sin is evidently the sin of pride, as in: Joe Biden was just too damn proud to let go of power. And due to his sinfulness, our democracy is now on the brink of collapse.\n\nMost of the attention seems to be on the question of Biden’s cognitive decline. Virtually none is on the question itself and the reasons behind it. That’s because, according to the logic of the Washington press corps, it’s normal to blame Democrats for the choices of Republicans. The thinking goes that Trump didn’t win. Biden handed him victory.\n\nBecause Democrats are the only ones with agency, they are the only ones held accountable. Donald Trump and the Republicans are therefore free to say whatever they want with an understanding among reporters who provide coverage that there’s no stopping them.\n\nThis is why there was so much reporting on Biden’s age, before the election and now afterward, but nothing close to equivalent coverage of the current president’s blindingly obvious mental deterioration. If there was a cover up for Biden, there is surely a cover up for Trump. But given the state of today’s news, we may never know about it.\n\nThe impact of this double standard goes beyond media framing. It can warp public understanding of politics, according to Scott Lemieux. Scott teaches constitutional law at the University of Washington. He’s probably best known as co-founder of Lawyers, Guns and Money.\n\nIn this interview with me, Scott explains why he believes that even if Biden had dropped out after the 2022 midterms, Vice President Kamala Harris would have been the Democratic Party’s nominee.\n\nScott said that to say Trump won because Biden didn't step down “is at best a vast oversimplification driven by a political vision in which Democrats are the only actors (and letting the press entirely off the hook for the normalization of Trump, even in the wake of January 6.)”\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's establish some facts. Was there a cover up? Or are Tapper and Thompson pandering to the Republicans by piling on Biden?\n\nThis may not be a fully satisfying answer, but I think there's some of both. Clearly, Tapper and Thompson are playing on Biden's unpopularity and Republican desires to distract from Trump’s countless problems to sell books. But Biden does seem to have declined pretty substantially in his last 12 to 18 months in office. I think it's clear he should not have run again, and Biden's inner circle were not sufficiently candid with the public, or in advising the president.\n\nHow do this play into your view of Tapper and Thompson's book? Trump isn't a spring chicken either. He's corrupt to the core. Yet Tapper said recently that this “cover up” was worse than Watergate .\n\nUnlike EMAILS, or most of the Hunter Biden stuff, Biden's age and ability to run again, and the conduct of his closest advisors, were real issues worthy of coverage. But there remain real questions of proportionality. The risks of an aging president \"mysteriously\" became much less central to press coverage when Harris became the Democratic nominee, and the full-court press on this book is detracting from Trump's increasing incoherence and apparent lack of command of the policies being issued by his own administration.\n\nObviously, Tapper and Thompson have a book to sell, and it is what it is, but people will have a legitimate beef against the press if Trump’s age and decline don't get a proportionate amount of coverage.\n\nWe're talking about more than proportionality. We're talking about a press corps that tends to hold the Democrats accountable for the Republicans' choices. The New Yorker excerpt of Original Sin was titled \" How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump .\"\n\nI would also take issue with the empirical assumption being made.\n\nWhile I agree that Biden should not have run again, had he stepped down after the midterms, the result probably would have been Vice President Kamala Harris still being the nominee after an extremely divisive primary in which Gaza would have played a major role.\n\nAny serious analysis of the 2024 elections needs to start with the fact that Harris did better than any other peer incumbent since 2021. That's not to say that she was a perfect candidate or ran a flawless campaign, but \"Trump only won because Biden didn't step down in 2022\" is at best a vast oversimplification driven by a political vision in which Democrats are the only actors (and letting the press entirely off the hook for the normalization of Trump, even in the wake of January 6.)\n\nRelated to the “cover up” of Biden's age are the allegations that elite Democrats covered up the truth about Biden's primary victory in 2020. You wrote recently about how this book invites rewriting that history, and rewriting it badly. Can you explain?\n\nTapper recently asserted that the 2020 primary was the result of a metaphorical \"smoke filled room\" in which \"Barack Obama and others called Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Booker and Warren and all the others, and encouraged them to drop out and get behind Biden.\"\n\nFirst, there's the factual sloppiness. Booker dropped out in January, Warren (and Bloomberg) didn't drop out before Super Tuesday. That sloppiness isn't just incidental. When you look at what really happened -- two minor candidates with little money and who had no appeal outside of the small white rural states frontloaded in the process dropped out, as happens in every competitive primary -- it's very, very obvious that it was immaterial to the outcome of the race.\n\nWhat actually happened is that Democratic elites were at best mostly lukewarm about Biden, and were hoping that a younger candidate would emerge. I'm sure there was some coordination between Obama and Klobuchar/Buttegeig after South Carolina and Alabama, but the conventional wisdom Tapper repeats gets cause and effect backwards. Party elites wanted to unite around Biden, because his win had become inevitable. It wasn't the reason Biden's win was inevitable.\n\nAn honest account of the 2020 primary would start with the fact that Biden was (for better or worse) the clear choice of Democratic voters, not the result of some elite conspiracy. And going forward, the left of the party needs to recognize that the strategy pursued by Bernie Sanders in 2020 -- run a factional campaign and hope to win as a minority candidate at a contested convention -- was a dead end, tactically and democratically, that shouldn't be tried again.\n\nLast question. Swing for the fences. Why is political journalism so dumb? It could be really good, but it's not. And it's making us dumber. There seems to be no incentive in the other direction.\n\nThis is a complex question. I'm not sure I understand why. Obviously, there's plenty of good work being done by individual reporters and outlets. The biggest problem is at the editorial level. As you said earlier, there's a strong latent tendency to make Democrats the main characters of the political universe, and hold them to higher standards. This was particularly evident in 2016, when Trump was covered as a sideshow and Clinton was covered as if she was the president-elect.\n\nOne really glaring example was the refusal of any mainstream outlet to publish any of the hacked material about the Trump campaign provided by Iranian intelligence . In isolation, this is perfectly defensible. None of the material that surfaced was particularly interesting, and I think there should be a pretty tough standard for publishing hacked material, because of the bad incentives.\n\nBut it's impossible to square with the media's conduct in 2016, in which hacked material spun on behalf of Trump received enormous amounts of coverage despite containing no serious news value.\n\nThe press is not obliged to learn from its mistakes, but it owed the public an explanation, and the fact that editors generally didn't feel that it was owed one is very telling. I don't think there's an easy solution, but we need to start by acknowledging there's a real problem.\n\nNOW READ: The question no one is asking",

Another official, however, cautioned the restructuring will likely not be a “major reform” but rather a “readjustment” of resources.\n\nWhat’s on the chopping block\n\nThe Parliament’s leadership intends to gradually reassign existing staff members to jobs in other departments or to reallocate posts after employees retire.\n\nLess clear is what happens with subcontracted temporary positions — so-called externals — who often work in areas such as audiovisual services, website maintenance and event organization.\n\nSpecifically, the administration is considering withdrawing funding for events such as the Brussels 20-kilometer race. | Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nAt first, senior leadership planned to discontinue up to 50 percent of external contracts, according to the minutes of an internal meeting seen by POLITICO. But those cuts are likely to be less drastic, according to one of the three officials. (Colard refused to provide the number of externals currently employed in the communications department.)\n\nOverall, the Parliament’s outreach and campaign activities are likely to be most affected. Specifically, the administration is considering withdrawing funding for events such as the Brussels 20-kilometer race, grants for organizations at the regional and local level, and art exhibitions, according to a draft plan seen by POLITICO.\n\nIt may also slash part of its budget for awards, according to the three Parliament officials, including the LUX Audience Award for films, the European Citizen’s Prize and the European Charlemagne Youth Prize for youth projects promoting democracy.\n\nThe Europa Experience initiative, a project to establish EU-themed spaces across all 27 member countries, has already suffered cuts because of soaring costs and lackluster visitor numbers.\n\nThe uncertainty has caused some staffers to look elsewhere to build their careers, especially in the newly created legislative directorates, according to two of the officials POLITICO spoke to. “The feeling now is that the future is in the new directorates if you want to grow professionally,” one of them said.",

        "content": "Today (4 June 2025), I am laying before Parliament the draft amended national policy statement for ports (NPSP).\n\nThe extant NPSP was designated in 2012. It sets out the need for development of ports in England and at reserved trust ports in Wales, currently Milford Haven. The NPSP provides guidance for applicants in preparing and for the Secretary of State in determining applications for development consent orders ( DCOs ) for sea port applications.\n\nThe previous government announced a review of the current NPSP in a written ministerial statement in March 2023. In light of our missions and priorities, this government has continued that review and has decided to amend the document.\n\nToday, I have launched a public consultation on a draft revised NPSP, along with an appraisal of sustainability ( AoS ) and habitats regulations assessment ( HRA ). These are subject to a public consultation period of 8 weeks and to Parliamentary scrutiny in parallel. My department is also publishing port freight demand forecasts for the United Kingdom as a whole, to which the draft NPSP refers. The documents are available on GOV. UK .\n\nI will place copies of the public consultation document, the appraisal of sustainability, and the habitats regulation assessment in the libraries of the House. The public consultation will close on 29 July 2025. The relevant period for parliamentary scrutiny will be from 4 June to 14 November 2025.\n\nThe review of the NPSP is proceeding in parallel with our wider programme of planning reforms, including the Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently before this House, designed to expedite and facilitate decision-making and stimulate growth and green energy transformation.",

        "content": "As the Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) prepares to reconvene, the South Sudan Land Alliance (SSuLA), a coalition of civil society organizations and land rights advocates, has called on the House to prioritize the passage of the National Land Policy, stressing that continued delays are detrimental.\n\nThe policy, which was approved by the Council of Ministers on 27 October 2023 and tabled before the TNLA on 21 November 2024, has been in development for nearly two decades.\n\nAddressing journalists on Wednesday in Juba, Dorothy Drabuga, the chairperson of the Alliance, emphasized the importance of passing the policy to address ongoing land-related challenges in South Sudan.\n\n“In advance of parliament’s reopening, SSuLA, backed by more than 50 national and international organizations and with support from the Rights and Resources Initiatives (RRI), has released an open letter urging lawmakers to pass the NLP without further delay,” she said.\n\nAccording to Drabuga, a campaign titled Land for South Sudan highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive framework to resolve land disputes, secure land tenure, and promote sustainable development, particularly for Indigenous Peoples, local communities, women, and youth.\n\n“For nearly 20 years, South Sudanese communities have waited for a land policy that safeguards their rights, reduces conflict, and unlocks development opportunities,” she stated. “With Parliament set to reopen, we urge lawmakers to act boldly and make the National Land Policy a top legislative priority.”\n\nAdditionally, the SSuLA chairperson noted that the policy’s delay continues to impede the implementation of critical provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement (R-ARCSS), signed on 18 September 2018.\n\n“Article 4.8.2.1.1 of the agreement mandates the timely development and implementation of a national land policy as part of the broader land reform agenda,” she said. “In the open letter addressed to Rt. Hon. Speaker Jemma Nunu Kumba and Hon. Ambrose Lomin, Chairperson of the Committee on Land and Physical Infrastructure, SSuLA, outline three urgent calls to action.”\n\nShe explained that the letter urges parliament to accelerate deliberation and approve the NLP without further delay, commit financial and technical resources for its implementation, and ensure that the policy aligns with international standards for land rights, particularly those of marginalized communities.\n\n“The NLP represents more than legislation. It is a pathway to peace, equity, and environmental resilience,” Drabuga stressed. “Failure to act risks deepening land disputes, discouraging sustainable investment, and worsening climate vulnerability.”\n\nWith land-related conflicts persisting across the country, advocates argue that the passage of the NLP would mark a historic step toward stability and inclusive development.\n\nFor his part, Ter Manyang, Executive Director of the Center for Peace and Advocacy (CPA), emphasized the fact that there is a need for the creation of legal awareness and implementation of the current laws, especially where there are currently rampant land disputes.\n\n“Many women are unaware of their rights under statutory law, and even when aware, they may face difficulties in asserting those rights due to a lack of awareness or resources,” he stated. “Institutional barriers and gender-biased practices within the justice system also impede women’s access to redress for land-related violations.”\n\nFurthermore, the Center for Peace and Advocacy called for coordinated efforts between the government, land institutions, and other partner organizations operating in South Sudan.\n\n“Addressing women’s land rights requires a multi-faceted approach, including strengthening legal frameworks, promoting gender equality in land administration, raising awareness of women’s rights, and ensuring access to justice,” he said.\n\nAccording to Manyang, there is a need for increased coordination among land actors, including government agencies, NGOs, and community organizations.",

Federica Di Sario explores some of the frictions hindering the success of Europe’s single market and I examine the role of Europe’s workforce in its competitiveness drive.\n\nIn the opinion section, MEP Tsvetelina Penkova outlines how the EU can support its digital businesses, MEP Lidia Pereira makes the case for completing the Capital Markets Union and MEP Christophe Grudler argues for tweaking competition rules and encouraging consumers to buy European.\n\nCompetitiveness may remain an opaque word for some, but as Europe’s global strength becomes a sharper focus, the C-word might just start to take shape.\n\n- Matt Lynes is opinion & policy report editor",

While many AI systems pose minimal risk, they need to be assessed.\n\n\n\nUnacceptable risk\n\nBanned AI applications in the EU include:\n\nCognitive behavioural manipulation of people or specific vulnerable groups: for example voice-activated toys that encourage dangerous behaviour in children\n\nSocial scoring AI: classifying people based on behaviour, socio-economic status or personal characteristics\n\nBiometric identification and categorisation of people\n\nReal-time and remote biometric identification systems, such as facial recognition in public spaces\n\n\n\nSome exceptions may be allowed for law enforcement purposes. “Real-time” remote biometric identification systems will be allowed in a limited number of serious cases, while “post” remote biometric identification systems, where identification occurs after a significant delay, will be allowed to prosecute serious crimes and only after court approval.\n\nHigh risk\n\n\n\nAI systems that negatively affect safety or fundamental rights will be considered high risk and will be divided into two categories:\n\n1) AI systems that are used in products falling under the EU’s product safety legislation. This includes toys, aviation, cars, medical devices and lifts.\n\n2) AI systems falling into specific areas that will have to be registered in an EU database:\n\nManagement and operation of critical infrastructure\n\nEducation and vocational training\n\nEmployment, worker management and access to self-employment\n\nAccess to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nMigration, asylum and border control management\n\nAssistance in legal interpretation and application of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll high-risk AI systems will be assessed before being put on the market and also throughout their lifecycle. People will have the right to file complaints about AI systems to designated national authorities.\n\nTransparency requirements\n\n\n\nGenerative AI, like ChatGPT, will not be classified as high-risk, but will have to comply with transparency requirements and EU copyright law:\n\nDisclosing that the content was generated by AI\n\nDesigning the model to prevent it from generating illegal content\n\nPublishing summaries of copyrighted data used for training\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk, such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, would have to undergo thorough evaluations and any serious incidents would have to be reported to the European Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nContent that is either generated or modified with the help of AI - images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they come across such content.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament approved a significant position regarding EU standards for the breeding, housing, and handling of cats and dogs. This initiative introduces the first EU regulations focused on the welfare and traceability of dogs and cats, with a vote resulting in 35 in favour, two against, and nine abstentions. Given that approximately 44% of households within the EU have a pet, the trade in dogs and cats has expanded notably in recent years, now valued at €1.3 billion annually, as reported by the Commission. It is worth noting that the online market, including illegal activities, accounts for 60% of all dog and cat sales in the EU.\n\nIn response to the absence of unified minimum animal welfare standards across member states, the Commission proposed these new rules on 7 December 2023. The regulations would apply to individuals and entities involved in breeding or selling dogs and cats in establishments and shelters, as well as those facilitating placements into foster homes. However, the regulations will not extend to private dog and cat owners who occasionally place a maximum of one litter on the market, provided this occurs less frequently than every 18 months.\n\nUnder the proposed regulations, all dogs and cats held by breeders, sellers, and shelters, or those offered for sale or donation online, must be individually identifiable through microchipping. These microchipped animals are required to be registered in interoperable national databases. The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) propose that the identification numbers of microchips, along with relevant details regarding the corresponding national database, be maintained in a single index database managed by the Commission.\n\nTo address potential loopholes that could allow dogs and cats to enter the EU as non-commercial pets, which may later be sold, MEPs recommend extending the proposed rules to encompass not only imports for commercial purposes but also non-commercial movements. Accordingly, dogs and cats imported from third countries for sale must be microchipped before entering the EU and subsequently registered in a national database within two working days of arrival. Additionally, pet owners arriving in the EU will be required to pre-register their microchipped animals in an online database at least five working days prior to their arrival.\n\nThe proposed regulations also prohibit breeding between direct relatives, including parents and offspring, grandparents and grandchildren, as well as between siblings and half-siblings. Puppies and kittens may not be separated from their mothers until they have reached a minimum age of eight weeks unless specific veterinary justification is provided. To ensure ethical practices, the regulations will limit the number of litters a female may have and will establish mandatory rest periods between pregnancies.\n\nFurthermore, the MEPs advocate for a prohibition on breeding dogs or cats with excessive conformational traits that may lead to significant welfare issues, as well as banning these animals—along with mutilated dogs and cats—from participating in shows, exhibitions, or competitions. The report is now prepared for a vote in the Parliament’s plenary session. If adopted, negotiations with EU government ministers will commence.\n\n“This proposal is a clear move against illegal breeding and the irresponsible importation of animals from outside the EU. At the same time, it fully respects ordinary owners and responsible breeders who should not be unduly burdened by regulations,” rapporteur and Chair of the AGRI Committee, Veronika Vrecionová (ECR, CZ), said after the vote.",

        "position": 1,
        "content": "FLOODING from incessant rain caused by the recent depression in the Bay of Bengal has remained somewhat unchanged while the government’s disaster management and relief efforts are barely visible. Four of the five north-eastern rivers that were flowing above their danger marks further swelled, as the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre reported in its last cycle on June 3. It is likely that rain would continue and some areas will remain flooded in the north-east. The onrush of water from the upstream region in India into these rivers has forced several hundred families to move to safety, also to flood shelter centres. The death toll from the flash flood and landslide has, meanwhile, already reached 15. Road connectivity and economic activities in the flood-hit areas have been disrupted. It is concerning that the government’s role has so far been limited to observing the disaster situation and issuing warnings, especially when flash floods from heavy rain became a cause for concern in the recent past.\n\nPreventive efforts to minimise the loss of life and public suffering from heavy rainfall should have already been in place. That has not, however, been the case. In Sylhet, the government has opened flood shelters but was not prompt enough to relocate people living in areas at landslide risk. The death of four members of a family from landslides in Sylhet speaks of the government’s inaction. Emergency response to help to alleviate the sufferings of people is the need of the hour, but equally important it is to address the root cause of frequent flash flooding. Local leaders put the flash flood mainly down to the unplanned construction of roads and other infrastructure that, too, grabbing canals and blocking low-lying areas that could, otherwise, drain out floodwater. Such infrastructure also includes long stretches of rural roads that block water from receding. Coupled with this is the problem of waning capacity of the rivers and canals to deal with excess water flow coming from the upstream.\n\nIn this context, the government should immediately take steps to minimise the loss of life and public suffering in the north-eastern flood-affected areas. In doing so, it should take early steps to relocate people living in areas already identified as risky for landslides and arrange transport and shelter for people living in the worst-hit areas. More important, the government should ensure emergency food and cash aid for people directly affected by the flash flood and landslide from the heavy rainfall. It should also pull down road stretches and infrastructure that block the natural flow of floodwater and dredge the rivers to increase their capacity to flush out floodwater and collected rainwater.",

State Councilor Stephane Ganzer told Radio Television Suisse that 90% of the village was destroyed.\n\nThe Cantonal Police of Valais said a search and rescue operation was underway for the missing 64-year-old man, involving a drone with a thermal camera.\n\nGlaciers vulnerable to climate change\n\nSwitzerland's glaciers have been severely affected by climate change.\n\nIn the years 2022 and 2023, they melted just as much as they had in the decades from 1960 through 1990.\n\nMatthias Huss, head of the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland, pointed to the likely influence of climate change in loosening the rock mass in the permafrost zone, which triggered the glacier collapse and the subsequent landslide.\n\n\"Unexpected things happen at places that we have not seen for hundreds of years, most probably due to climate change,\" he told Reuters.\n\nSwiss glacier collapse partially destroys village of Blatten To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nConcerns rising over blocked river\n\nAuthorities have declared a state of emergency as they monitor the situation of the huge pile of glacier debris, stretching 2 kilometers (1.25 miles), blocking the Lonza River.\n\n\"There is a serious risk of an ice jam that could flood the valley below,\" Antoine Jacquod, a military security official, told the Keystone-ATS news agency. \"We're going to try to assess its dimensions.\"\n\nWith the area too unstable to be approached, authorities indicated that an assessment would be made during the late afternoon from the nearby village of Ferden.\n\nThe deluge of mud, ice and debris has blocked the Lonza River Image: Jean-Christophe Bott/KEYSTONE/dpa/picture alliance\n\nAs a precaution, 16 people were evacuated late Wednesday from two villages downstream from the disaster area.\n\nAn artificial dam has been emptied to receive the water pushed back by the wall of ice, earth and rubble. Were that water to overflow from the dam, authorities would need to consider evacuating the valley.\n\n\"The deposit ... is not very stable, and debris flow is possible within the deposit itself [which] makes any intervention in the disaster area impossible for the time being,\" cantonal authorities said. They added that there is risk on both sides of the valley.\n\nResidents shocked by scale of destruction\n\nMartin Henzen, a Blatten resident, told Reuters that he was still trying to process what had occurred and did not want to speak for others in the village. \"Most are calm,\" Henzen said, \"but they're obviously affected.\"\n\nHenzen said residents had been making preparations for some kind of natural disaster but \"not for this scenario,\" referring to the scale of destruction.\n\nOne man was reported missing after the landslide Image: Jean-Christophe Bott/KEYSTONE/dpa/picture alliance\n\nUp to 1 million cubic meters (35 million cubic feet) of water could accumulate daily as a result of the debris damming up the river, and the buildings that emerged intact from the landslide are now flooding.\n\nAuthorities have been airlifting livestock out of the area.\n\n\"Right now,\" said Jonas Jeitziner, an official in neighboring Wiler, \"the shock is so profound that one can't think about it yet.\"\n\nEdited by: Zac Crellin",

        "content": "Relentless monsoon rains across the northeastern states leave a trail of deaths and destruction.\n\nAt least 30 people have died in India’s northeast after relentless monsoon rains caused floods and landslides over the weekend, Indian officials and media reports say.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday said at least eight people were killed in Assam state and nine more in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, many of them buried under earth and debris dislodged by the torrential downpour.\n\nThree members of one family were killed in a mudslide in Assam’s Guwahati, officials said, as heavy rains led to flooding in many areas of the city, leading to long power outages and prompting authorities to shut schools and colleges on Saturday.\n\nAuthorities disconnected electricity in several areas to reduce the risk of electrocution, Assam’s Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.\n\nIn Mizoram state, five people lost their lives in a landslide, while six others died in Meghalaya state. Officials in Nagaland and Tripura states also confirmed two deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghalaya’s Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma ordered emergency teams to stay vigilant, “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, he warned in a public statement.\n\nThe Indian Army launched a large-scale rescue effort in Manipur state, evacuating hundreds. “People have been shifted to safer places,” the army said. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.”\n\nThe downpour has continued for three straight days, and India’s weather agency has forecast more heavy rains in the region in the coming days as it issued a red alert for several northeastern districts.\n\nRivers across the region, including the Brahmaputra, which originates in the Himalayas and flows through India into Bangladesh, have breached their banks, submerging vast areas and cutting off access to many communities.\n\nFloods and landslides are common during India’s June-to-September monsoon season, which is vital for agriculture but often deadly. Dozens of people die each year as rainfall overwhelms fragile infrastructure across the world’s most populous country.\n\nLast month, Mumbai was deluged by rain nearly two weeks before its usual beginning, the earliest monsoon arrival in the capital city of the western state of Maharashtra in over two decades, according to meteorological officials.\n\nScientists say climate change is altering weather patterns across South Asia, but the precise effects on the monsoon system remain unclear.",

        "content": "The abandoned homes and razed lots along the meandering Troublesome Creek in rural eastern Kentucky is a constant reminder of the 2022 catastrophic floods that killed dozens of people and displaced thousands more.\n\nAmong the hardest hit was Fisty, a tiny community where eight homes, two shops and nine people including a woman who uses a wheelchair, her husband and two children, were swept away by the rising creek. Some residents dismissed cellphone alerts of potential flooding due to mistrust and warning fatigue, while for others it was already too late to escape. Landslides trapped the survivors and the deceased for several days.\n\nIn response, geologists from the University of Kentucky secured a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and raced around collecting perishable data in hope of better understanding the worst flooding event to hit the region in a generation.\n\nView image in fullscreen A landslide in Callaway, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nOn a recent morning in Fisty, Harold Baker sat smoking tobacco outside a new prefabricated home while his brother James worked on a car in a makeshift workshop. With no place else to go, the Baker family rebuilt the workshop on the same spot on Troublesome Creek with financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).\n\n“I feel depressed. Everyone else is gone now. The days are long. It feels very lonely when the storms come in,” said Baker, 55, whose four dogs drowned in 2022. With so few people left, the car repair business is way down, the road eerily quiet.\n\nSince the flood that took everything, Harold and James patrol the river every time it rains. The vigilance helped avert another catastrophe on Valentine’s Day after another so-called generational storm. No one died, but the trauma, like the river, came roaring back.\n\n“I thought we were going to lose everything again. It was scary,” said Baker.\n\nAt this spot in July 2022, geologist Ryan Thigpen found flood debris on top of two-storey buildings – 118in (3 metres) off the ground. The water mark on Harold’s new trailer shows the February flood hit 23in.\n\nTroublesome Creek is a 40-mile narrow tributary of the north fork of the Kentucky River, which, like many waterways across southern Appalachia, does not have a single gauge. Yet these rural mountain hollows are getting slammed over and over by catastrophic flooding – and landslides – as the climate crisis increases rainfall across the region and warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico turbocharge storms.\n\nTwo years after 45 people died in the 2022 floods, the scale of disaster grew with Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 230 people with almost half the deaths in Appalachia, after days of relentless rain turned calm streams into unstoppable torrents.\n\nAnother 23 people died during the February 2025 rains, then 24 more in April during a four-day storm that climate scientists found was made significantly more likely and more severe by the warming planet.\n\nView image in fullscreen James and Harold Baker in their tool shed in Fisty, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nThe extreme weather is making life unbearable and economically unviable for a chronically underserved region where coal was once king, and climate skepticism remains high. Yet little is known about flooding in the Appalachian region. It’s why the geologists – also called earth scientists – got involved.\n\n“This is where most people are going to die unless we create reliable warning systems and model future flood risks for mitigation and to help mountain communities plan for long-term resilience. Otherwise, these extreme flooding events could be the end of southern Appalachia,” said Thigpen.\n\nAmid accelerating climate breakdown, the urgency of the mission is clear. Yet this type of applied science could be derailed – or at least curtailed – by the unprecedented assault on science, scientists and federal agencies by Donald Trump and his billionaire donors.\n\nDanielle Baker, James’s wife, had her bags packed a week in advance of the February flood and was glued to local television weather reports, which, like the geologists, rely on meteorological forecasting by the taxpayer-funded National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nShe was “scared to death” watching the creek rise so high again. But this time, the entire family, including 11 dogs and several cats, evacuated to the church on the hill, where they waited 26 hours for the water to subside.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jason Dortch and Ryan Thigpen document the water line on a trailer from the 2025 flooding in Fisty, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\n“The people in this community are the best you could meet, but it’s a ghost town now. I didn’t want to rebuild so close to the creek, but we had nowhere else to go. Every time it rains, I can’t sleep,” she said, wiping away tears with her shirt.\n\nDanielle was unaware of Trump’s plans to dismantle Fema and slash funding from the NWS and NSF. “A lot of people here would not know what to do without Fema’s help. We need more information about the weather, better warnings, because the rains are getting worse,” she said.\n\nA day after the Guardian’s visit in mid-May, an NWS office in eastern Kentucky scrambled to cover the overnight forecast as severe storms moved through the region, triggering multiple tornadoes that eventually killed 28 people. Hundreds of staff have left the NWS in recent months, through a combination of layoffs and buyouts at the behest of Trump mega-donor Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).\n\nIt doesn’t matter if people don’t believe in climate change. It’s going to wallop them anyway … This is a new world of extremes and cascading hazards Ryan Thigpen, geologist\n\nYet statewide, two-thirds of Kentuckians voted for Trump last year, with his vote share closer to 80% in rural communities hit hard by extreme weather, where many still blame Barack Obama for coal mine closures.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if people don’t believe in climate change. It’s going to wallop them anyway. We need to think about watersheds differently. This is a new world of extremes and cascading hazards,” said Thigpen, the geologist.\n\nThe rapidly changing climate is rendering the concept of once-in-a-generation floods, which is mostly based on research by hydrologists going back a hundred years or so, increasingly obsolete. Geologists, on the other hand, look back 10,000 years, which could help better understand flooding patterns when the planet was warmer.\n\nThigpen is spearheading this close-knit group of earth scientists from the university’s hazards team based in Lexington. On a recent field trip, nerdy jokes and constant teasing helped keep the mood light, but the scientists are clearly affected by the devastation they have witnessed since 2022. The team has so far documented more than 3,000 landslides triggered by that single extreme rain event, and are still counting.\n\nView image in fullscreen University of Kentucky earth scientists at the base of a landslide in Callaway, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nThis work is part of a broader statewide push to increase climate resiliency and bolster economic growth using Kentucky-specific scientific research. Last year, the initiative got a major boost when the state secured $24m from the NSF for a five-year research project involving eight Kentucky institutions that has created dozens of science jobs and hundreds of new student opportunities.\n\nThe grant helped pay for high-tech equipment – drones, radars, sensors and computers – the team needs to collect data and build models to improve hazard prediction and create real-time warning systems.\n\nView image in fullscreen An active Lidar scan on the drone controller flown by Ryan Thigpen in Hazard, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nAfter major storms, the team measures water levels and analyzes the sediment deposits left behind to calculate the scale and velocity of the flooding, which in turn helps calibrate the model.\n\nThe models help better understand the impact of the topography and each community’s built and natural environment – important for future mitigation. In these parts, coal was extracted using mountaintop mine removal, which drastically altered the landscape. Mining – and redirected waterways – can affect the height of a flood, according to a recent study by PhD student Meredith Swallom.\n\nA paleo-flood project is also under way, and another PhD student, Luciano Cardone, will soon begin digging into a section of the Kentucky riverbank to collect layers of sediment that holds physical clues on the date, size and velocity of ancient floods. Cardone, who found one local missionary’s journal describing flooding in 1795, will provide a historical or geological perspective on catastrophic flooding in the region, which the team believe will help better predict future hazards under changing climatic conditions.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Lidar drone flying a geological survey near the Perry county public library in Hazard, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nAll this data is analyzed at the new lab located in the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) department, where super-powerful computers are positioned around a ceiling-to-floor black board, with a groovy lamp and artwork to get the creative mathematical juices flowing.\n\nSo far the team has developed one working flood risk model for a single section of the Kentucky River. This will serve as a template, as each watershed requires its own model so that the data is manageable, precise and useful.\n\nThis sort of applied science has the capacity to directly improve the lives of local people, including many Trump voters, as well as benefiting other mountainous flood-prone areas across the US and globally. But a flood warning system can only work if there is reliable meteorological forecasting going forward.\n\nThe floods have made this a ghost town. I doubt it will survive another one. If you mess with Mother Nature, you lose Thomas Hutton of Kentucky\n\nReports suggest NWS weather balloons, which assess storm risk by measuring wind speed, humidity, temperature and other conditions that satellites may not detect, have been canceled in recent weeks from Nebraska to Florida due to staff shortages. At the busiest time for storm predictions, deadly heatwaves and wildfires, weather service staffing is down by more than 10% and, for the first time in almost half a century, some forecasting offices no longer have 24/7 cover.\n\nTrump’s team is also threatening to slash $1.52bn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the weather service’s parent agency, which also monitors climate trends, manages coastal ecosystems and supports international shipping, among other things.\n\n“To build an effective and trusted warning system, we need hyper-local data, including accurate weather forecasts and a more robust network of gauges,” said Summer Brown, a senior lecturer at the University of Kentucky’s earth and environmental sciences department. “The thought of weakening our basic weather data is mind-boggling.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Summer Brown speaks with Doug Naselroad at Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company in Hindman, Kentucky, on 14 May.\n\nIt’s impossible not to worry about the cuts, especially as the grand plan is to create a southern Appalachian flood and hazard centre to better understand and prepare the entire region’s mountain communities for extreme weather and related hazards, including flash floods, landslides and tornadoes.\n\nFor this, the team is currently awaiting a multimillion-dollar grant decision from the NSF, in what until recently was a merit-based, peer-reviewed process at the federal agency. The NSF director resigned in April after orders from the White House to accept a 55% cut to the $9bn budget and fire half of the 1,700-person staff. Then, in an unprecedented move, a member of the governing body stepped down, lambasting Musk’s unqualified Doge team for interfering in grant decisions.\n\nThe days are long. It feels very lonely when the storms come in Harold Baker of Kentucky\n\nThe NSF is the principal federal investor in basic science and engineering, and the proposed cut will be devastating in the US and globally.\n\n“Rivers are different all over Appalachia, and if our research continues, we can build accurate flood and landslide models that help communities plan for storms in a changing climate,” said Jason Dortch, who set up the flood lab. “We’ve submitted lots of great grant proposals, and while that is out of our hands, we will continue to push forwarded however we can.”\n\n\n\nFleming-Neon is a former mining community in Letcher county with roughly 500 residents – a decline of almost 40% in the past two decades. The town was gutted by the 2022 storm, and only two businesses, a car repair shop and a florist, reopened. The launderette, pharmacy, dentist, clothing store and thrift shop were all abandoned.\n\nView image in fullscreen The front of a home damaged by a large landslide in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nRandall and Bonnie Kincer, a local couple who have been married for 53 years, run the flower shop from an old movie theater on Main Street, which doubles up as a dance studio for elementary school children. The place was rammed with 120in of muddy water in 2022. In February, it was 52in, and everything still reeks of mould.\n\nThe couple have been convinced by disinformation spread by conspiracy theorists that the recent catastrophic floods across the region, as well as Helene, were caused by inadequate river dredging and cloud seeding. The town’s sorry plight, according to the Kincers, is down to deliberate manipulation of the weather system paid for by mining companies to flood out the community in order to gain access to lithium. (There are no significant lithium deposits in the area.)\n\nBonnie, 74, is on the brink of giving up on the dance classes that she has taught since sophomore year, but not on Trump. “I have total confidence in President Trump. The [federal] cuts will be tough for a little while but there’s a lot of waste, so it will level out,” said Bonnie, who is angry about not qualifying for Fema assistance.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bonnie and Randall Kincer in the gymnasium at Busy B’s Country Gift Shop in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May 2025.\n\n“We used all our life savings fixing the studio. But I cannot shovel any more mud, not even for the kids. I am done. I have PTSD. We are scared to death,” she said, breaking down in tears several times.\n\nThe fear is understandable. On the slope facing the studio, a tiered retainer wall has been anchored into the hill to stabilize the earth and prevent an avalanche from destroying the town below.\n\nAnd at the edge of town, next to the power station on an old mine site, is a towering pile of black sludgy earth littered with lumps of shiny coal – the remnants of a massive landslide that happened as residents cleaned up after the February storm.\n\nThomas Hutton’s house was swamped with muddy water after the landslide blocked the creek, forcing it to temporarily change course towards a residential street. “The floods have made this a ghost town. I doubt it will survive another one. If you mess with Mother Nature, you lose,” said Hutton, 74, a retired miner.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thomas Sutton at his home near a landslide in Fleming-Neon, Kentucky, on 15 May.\n\nThe geologists fly drones fitted with Lidar (light detection and ranging): a remote sensing technology that uses pulsed lasers to create high-resolution, 3D, color models of the Earth’s surface, and can shoot through trees and human-made structures to detect and monitor changes in terrain including landslides. The affordability and precision of the China-made Lidar has been a “game changer” for landslides, but prices have recently rocketed thanks to Trump’s tariff war.\n\nThe Lidar picked up fairly recent deforestation above the Fleming-Neon power plant, which likely further destabilized the earth. The team agrees that the landslide could keep moving, but without good soil data it’s impossible to know when.\n\nLast year’s NSF grant funded new soil and moisture sensors, as well as mini weather stations, which the landslide team is in the process of installing on 14 steep slopes in eastern Kentucky – the first time this has been done – including one opposite Hutton’s house.\n\nBack at the lab, the geologists will use the data the sensors send back every 15 minutes to create models – and eventually a website where residents and local emergency managers can see how the soil moisture is changing in real time. The goal is to warn communities when there is a high landslide risk based on the soil saturation – and rain forecast.\n\n“We have taken so many resources from these slopes. We need to understand them better,” said Sarah Johnson, a landslide expert. “We’re not sitting in an ivory tower making money from research. The work we do is about making communities safer.”",

Officials report that 90% of the village has been destroyed.\n\nThe collapse caused debris to fill the bed of the Lonza River, creating a dam and causing a lake to form upstream. Officials warn that if the dam gives way, the resulting surge could flood communities downstream.\n\nAuthorities have begun dismantling pedestrian bridges and reinforcing critical infrastructure to prepare for possible flooding in Gampel and residents have been advised to arrange emergency accommodation in case of evacuation.\n\n\"I didn't sleep last night,\" one woman told reporters. \"We were constantly waiting - if something happens, we have to go.\"\n\nA pedestrian bridge preventively closed over the Lonza river after mud and rock slides, in Gampel-Steg. Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP\n\nTo mitigate the risk, authorities have emptied the Ferden dam downstream, hoping it can absorb some of the potential overflow if there is a breach.\n\nThe Swiss army has been deployed to the region but is currently unable to conduct ground operations due to ongoing instability.\n\nIn Blatten, the devastation is extensive. Aerial footage shows homes submerged in thick mud, with roads and structures either buried or swept away.\n\nAuthorities had evacuated more than 300 people, as well as livestock, from Blatten village as a precaution earlier this month, but one man remains missing following the incident.\n\nHowever, local police say the search and rescue operation has been temporarily suspended because of falling debris.\n\nPresident Karin Keller-Sutter visited the region earlier on Friday.",

        "content": "The Landslide Blog is written by Dave Petley, who is widely recognized as a world leader in the study and management of landslides.\n\nOn 28 April 2025, a major debris flow travelled down a channel from a major mountain, Vallunaraju, striking the communities lower down the slope. At least 100 houses were destroyed and two or three people were killed.\n\nI am not in a position to be able to say definitively how this event occurred. Christian Huggel from the University of Zurich has a LinkedIn post that provides some detail. This is a part of what he has posted:-\n\n“Summarizing some information on the recent glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) that occurred in the early morning of 28 April from one of the glacier lakes at the toe of Vallunaraju (5680 m asl) and badly impacted rural and urban parts of Huaraz in the Andes of Peru. According to videos taken by mountaineers the likely origin of the GLOF (or aluvión) is a rock slope failure into a lake in some 300 m distance of the glacier margin … The analysis suggests that the rock fall triggered an impact wave in the lake with a subsequent debris flow that rushed downvalley along the Casca river, damaged some 100 houses, destroyed about 15 buildings and road infrastructure, and unfortunately also claimed the lives of 2-3 persons. The glacier lake probably formed around the 1970’s as the glaciers of Vallunaraju receded.\n\n“Some lines of evidence suggest that there were rock fall events prior to the 28 April GLOF at this location, including pre-event slope failures likely the day before the disaster.”\n\nThis is a cloudy area, so at present I cannot access satellite imagery that shows the slopes affected by the landslide that initiated this event. However, Planet Labs has captured imagery on both 26 April 2025 (before the event) and 30 April 2025 (after the event) that provides some insights into the downstream consequences.\n\nLet’s start with the main channel higher in the slopes of Vallunaraju. This Planet Labs image shows the valley immediately below the steep slope from which this event originated. The marker is at [-9.44993, -77.45431]:-\n\nPlanet Labs image before the 28 April 2025 Glacial Outburst Flood (GLOF) / landslide at Vallunaraju in Peru.

Image dated 26 April 2025.\n\nThis is the same area after the landslide / GLOF:-\n\nPlanet Labs image of the aftermath of the 28 April 2025 Glacial Outburst Flood (GLOF) / landslide at Vallunaraju in Peru. Image copyright Planet Labs, used with permission. Image dated 30 April 2025.\n\nAnd here is a slider to compare the two images:-\n\nClearly, cloud is a major issue in the 30 April 2025 image, and we cannot see the main part of the slope itself, but at the foot of the steep slope extensive scour and erosion is evident, and there is substantial change in the channel below.\n\nThis has then led to major impacts in the channel downstream. This is a part of the 30 April 2025 image, with the channel running roughly east to west, with extensive evidence of the aftermath of the debris flow:-\n\nPlanet Labs image of the downstream impacts of the 28 April 2025 Glacial Outburst Flood (GLOF) / landslide at Vallunaraju in Peru.

        "content": "Evidence of landslide-flood interaction from DEM of Difference\n\nWe used a DEM of Difference (DoD) produced from pre and post flood LiDAR as detailed by ref. 14. Details of channel change analysis based on the DoD are given in the Methods. The first 7 km of the ~16 km study channel had little channel erosion (~1.4 m3/m) and an average widening rate of 5 m or just half of the average preflood channel width (9.94 m) and a width ratio (i.e. width after/before the flood) was 1.6 (Fig. 2). The valley floor remained largely undisturbed (also refer to37). From around 7 km downstream (i.e. entry point of landslide L2 in Fig. 2), channel erosion (~20.7 m3/m) was much greater and had an average widening of 28 m and a width ratio of 3.76. The flood almost fully occupied the valley floor and so widening was achieved mostly through removal of valley floor sediment, although with some potential evidence of bedrock erosion on outer bends of the channel (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 5). The most rapid transition occurs at 7 km downstream over the 3.5 km transition reach, where channel widening reached 67 m, width ratio reached 9.44, and erosion averaged 38 m3/m. This transition is not explained by peak flood stream power (Fig. 2), as estimated from radar-based rainfall data (see Methods), which increases gradually downstream but does not provide the trigger of the sudden increase in channel width ratio. Whilst channel confinement, calculated as the ratio of valley width to pre flood channel width, constrains channel widening beyond 7 km downstream (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3), there is little channel widening for the first 7 km of the channel despite relatively unconstrained channels (i.e., confinement ratio ≥310) along the entirety of the study channel. There are also no obvious variations in channel bank material or riparian vegetation that would explain this increase in channel widening. However, the sudden increase in channel erosion and widening does occur just downstream from three major lateral sediment inputs from two landslides (L1, L2 in Figs. 1C and 2) and a tributary, totaling ~105,000 m3. Further downstream increases in width ratio also correspond to large lateral sediment inputs, but we focus on explaining the largest peak highlighted in Fig. 2. We used a combination of field data and numerical modeling to investigate the potential mechanisms by which landslide-channel interactions may have resulted in the pattern of channel erosion observed. We tested the hypotheses that the pattern of channel erosion generated by the flood was amplified by (1) bulking of the flow by landslide and tributary sediment; (2) damming of the flow by landslide and tributary sediment, and subsequent failure of this dam resulting in an erosive flood surge similar to that observed in debris flows32.\n\nField evidence of landslide-flood interaction\n\nAs an initial test for sediment bulking or surging of the flow that may explain the sudden increase in channel erosion and widening, we calculated the ratio C (field-measured peak discharge/runoff-based peak discharge32). Flood flows can have a range of C values between 0 and 138. Due to conservation of mass, this ratio cannot exceed 1 in the absence of substantial sediment bulking or surge dynamics and can be used as a check on indirect measurements of flood discharge35. A value of C > 1 is diagnostic of bulking of the flow and a value of C > 2 is indicative of surging in the flow, that would provide initial support for hypotheses 1 and 2 respectively. We visited the reach of increased channel erosion in October 2016 and August 2017 to make indirect measurements of flood peak discharge (Q peak ) with which to compare our estimated runoff-based discharge (Q runoff ) (see Methods) and calculate the ratio C.\n\nWe used a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect pairs of highwater marks at 23 channel cross sections upstream and downstream from the transition reach (Fig. 1C) in 2016 and 2017 with a vertical and horizontal precision of 0.6 m and 0.4 m, respectively. We identified highwater marks from the 2013 flood based on debris lines on the channel banks and debris trapped in trees. These highwater marks were relatively undisturbed in the 3–4 years since the 2013 flood event given the absence of a larger flood event over this time period16. We used the highwater marks within ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, California) to extract cross sections from lidar data. Where there is deviation in highwater mark elevations between the left and right banks (i.e. resulting in different reconstructed water levels), we propagate this uncertainty into our estimation of peak discharge cross-section area (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Additionally, we calculated cross-section areas using both pre- and post-flood lidar to account for uncertain channel topography during the flood. We calculated peak discharge in m3 s-1 as\n\n$${Q}_{{peak}}={VA}$$ (1)\n\nwhere A is cross-section area in m2 and V is velocity in m s-1. Velocity was calculated using the critical flow method as:\n\n$$V=\\sqrt{{gR}}$$ (2)\n\nwhere R is hydraulic radius in m calculated as \\(R=\\frac{A}{P}\\), where P is wetted perimeter in m, g is acceleration due to gravity, and assuming critical flow (i.e., Froude number = 1). The critical flow method has been shown by35 to give values most representative of the average flow conditions during the flood from an ensemble of peak discharge estimation techniques, potentially due to smoothing of the channel bed by sediment infilling during the flood.\n\nAlthough Q runoff only slightly increases along the transition reach from about 217 to 218 m3/s, Q peak shows a rapid increase from 72 m3/s (±5 m3/s) to 468 m3/s (±190 m3/s) over the ~300 m downstream from L2 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the estimated runoff coefficient, C, also increases from 0.33 ( ± 0.02) to 2.15 ( ± 0.87), with values >2 diagnostic of surge type behavior as can occur in debris flows (Fig. 3C)32.\n\nFig. 3: Channel characteristics and flood discharge derived from field measurements and lidar data. A Channel slope along the transition reach shown in Fig. 2 showing a decrease in channel slope coinciding with modeled dam formation; (B) pre- and post-flood channel profiles in black and gray lines respectively and highwater marks (red and black open circles with error bars) collected at 23 cross sections showing wedge of sediment remaining after the flood downstream from L2; (C) Q peak calculated from high water marks together with lidar (Figs. S6 and S7 and Table S1) in red and black open circles with error bars and Q runoff modeled using rainfall data (dark blue line) and ratio of these (C) (lighter blue line with blue shading showing uncertainty). C > 1 is indicative of a dam burst event. Dark gray band shows location of modeled dam that formed around the point of entry of L2 (Fig. 4). Light gray band shows location of remnants of dam observed in the field (Supplementary Fig. 1). Full size image\n\nDownstream from the L2 landslide entry, a cobble and boulder rich bar is clearly visible in satellite photos (Supplementary Fig. 1) and was found to have a median grain size of 22 cm (Supplementary Fig. 4). The post-flood channel profile also shows this wedge of sediment (Fig. 3B). We used numerical modeling, detailed below and in Methods, to test the hypothesis that this bar is what remains of a dam that was formed and then removed during the flood (Hypothesis 2). The precise timing of landslides that could have caused a valley damming event is uncertain but previous modeling of landslides in the catchment (including L2) indicates landslides occurred shortly after storm rainfall peaked late in the evening on September 11, with landslides on south facing slopes (including L2) occurring late in the evening of September 11 and landslides on north facing slopes occurring in the early morning of September 1239. Witness accounts also record the first landslides happening at this time in neighboring catchments34,40.\n\nThe ratio C calculated based on our field observations supports hypothesis 2 of a dam failure event because the rapid jump in widening at a distinct channel location indicates that a surge of sediment and water similar to a debris flow would be needed to generate erosional widening over a short distance. A dam failure could explain the bank erosion by bulking the flow and generating a positive feedback on bank erosion and channel widening. This has been observed for other dam burst events19, and therefore the dam failure hypothesis may explain the observed profound channel widening of up to 67 m.\n\nMulti-phase modeling of landslide-flood interaction\n\nTo further test hypothesis 2 of a dam formation and failure event, we carried out numerical simulations with the computational model r.avaflow (v. 2.4)41 to simulate sediment delivery to the valley floor and its interactions with the fluid flow of North Saint Vrain Creek. The computational model r.avaflow is a freely available deterministic, multi-phase model, which is based on the principles of energy and momentum transfer between liquid and solid phases, extending the use of a Voellmy-type resistance model to multiple phases41,42. Furthermore, r.avaflow has been used to simulate a range of hydro-geomorphic process chains including rock avalanches43, transition of rock avalanches into debris flows44 to glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides into lakes45. For fluvial systems, r.avaflow has been validated for glacial debris flow mobility in mountainous river channels46, entrainment of sediment by debris flows in channels47, and channel changes from cascading rockslide-channelized debris flow42. Until recently, it has not been used to simulate landslide-flood interaction29, despite the likely role that sediment supply has in flood dynamics.\n\nFor the simulation input, we used the landslides mapped from the DoD for the solid phase and the discharge Q runoff for the fluid phase. Because the total simulation time is relatively small (900 s in total), the fluid hydrograph has been taken as a constant discharge, corresponding to the peak flow Q runoff . Because the landslides were mostly formed by coarse sediment (based on in situ observations after the event), the input sediment phase was considered only as coarse (i.e., friction-dominated for the model computations), whereas no input has been used for the fine phase (i.e., inclusive of viscous effects). Although large wood likely played a role in channel widening in this event14, r.avaflow currently does not include this component, but this could be considered in future versions of the model, particularly in the case of hyper-congested flows48. As detailed below, simulations support the formation and removal of a dam downstream of L2, lending support to hypothesis 2. However, it was necessary to perform the simulation in two stages due to a limitation of the model in the version used (2.4), where topography is not updated during the model simulation. In stage (1) dam formation is simulated related to triggering of landslides L1 and L2 and delivery of sediment to the channel and topography is updated to include the dam, and in stage (2) dam removal is simulated using updated topography from stage (1). Boundary conditions and flow hydrographs remain the same for both steps. In the model, landslides have been assumed to be released simultaneously. This had minor effects on the simulations because the delivery time to the valley bottom was different for each individual landslide, and all occurred within 30–45 s from the start of the simulation. Several sets of simulations have been conducted to explore the parameter space, including mobility and erosive parameters (such as drag coefficient and friction), as well as the hydrographs of the main channel and tributary (Supplementary Table 2). Because all parameters are physically based, we used values that are conventionally found in the literature or recommended by the r.avaflow manual49 depending on the type of event.\n\nFigure 4 shows the topographic change within the study area at the end of the simulations for both dam formation (first stage) (Fig. 4a) and dam removal (second stage) (Fig. 4b) superimposed on the observed post-event channel extent. Irrespective of the parameters used for the simulations, the model supports the formation of a large sediment dam in the channel downstream from L2, as well as another smaller dam upstream related to L1 (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, when the topography of the area is updated with the deposition (or erosion) heights from the first simulation stage, the second stage model runs (Fig. 4b) show that substantial erosion occurs, removing the large dam within the simulation time of 900 s. The bulk of the dam is eroded over a period of ~300 s and leads to the erosion and widening of the channel immediately downstream, due to bulking of the flow by sediment. After this time, changes to channel topography was, in comparison, negligible. The final simulated topographic change (Fig. 4c) corresponds well with the observed pattern of erosion from the DoD shown in Figs. 1c and 2. There are some discrepancies between the simulation and observations. For example, the simulated dam occurs closer to the toe of the landslide L2 than the remnants of the dam we observed in the field, which occur ~100 m downstream (Fig. 3). However, these are to be expected considering challenges in replicating spatially explicit two- and three-dimensional landscape evolution in fluvial morphodynamic models50.\n\nFig. 4: Results of simulations using r.avaflow. a formation of the sediment dam outlined by red polygon, (b) dam removal with updated topography, (c) the resulting topographic change after both simulations, (d) the results of the simulations with no landslide sediment delivery, highlighting the importance of landslide sediment delivery for simulating observed channel widening. The blue arrow indicates flow direction, whilst the dam extent was mapped for values of deposition ≥0.05 m. Pink polygons show landslides, blue polygon shows post-flood channel and green circles show highwater marks used for calculation of flood discharge (Q peak ) in Fig. 3. Full size image\n\nTo further test hypothesis 2 that the topographic change of the channel was caused by the formation and then removal of the sediment dam, we performed an additional simulation (Fig. 4d) without landslide sediment input, to evaluate whether the flood flow alone and the sediment it mobilized from upstream to downstream (i.e., not including landslide sediment input) could have caused the channel change. In this scenario, only limited erosion (i.e., <0.10 m) was observed in the main channel downstream from L2 and the extent was substantially smaller than the post-event observations.This is in contrast with the simulations inclusive of landslide input (Fig. 4c), in which the post-event channel extents were much more consistent with the observed changes. The simulated volume of erosion along the channel downstream of the sediment dam is only 518 m3 in the simulation without landslides, compared to 1779 m3 when landslides are included. We therefore conclude that a landslide-dam failure and rapid delivery of sediment best explains the observed geomorphic channel change during the flood. All the numerical simulations involving landslides qualitatively agree on the formation and removal of a dam, whereby the downstream channel widening resulted from bulking of the flow by sediment related to a removal of the debris dam. This lends support to both hypotheses 1 and 2, and the ability of the model to simulate geomorphic change during floods accounting for large lateral sediment supply supports hypothesis 3.",

Impact Link\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nTesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" becomes law.\n\nElon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost.\n\nMany of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts. That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly affect his businesses.\n\nWhile Musk has previously shared his disapproval of the bill, the billionaire ratcheted up his criticism this week.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk posted on X on Tuesday. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\"\n\n\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said in criticism directed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill.\n\nMusk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the President already knew where Musk stood on the spending bill and that the Tesla CEO's recent comments criticizing it wouldn't change Trump's stance.\n\nThe bill, which champions Trump's agenda, includes cuts to Medicaid and the extension of the tax cuts that the president signed into law during his first term in 2017. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime.\n\nIn regard to the companies Musk leads, the bill could have a mixed impact. While Tesla stands to lose, companies such as SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill.\n\nTesla's credits threatened\n\nThe bill, as written, makes big changes to the Biden-era EV tax credits, which are intended to encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used EVs.\n\nElectric vehicles would no longer qualify for the tax credit if the automaker sold more than 200,000 previously qualifying EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, if the bill became law. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone.\n\nMusk has previously said eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and affect the automaker as well. He said, however, that the move would probably help Tesla in the long term. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOthers don't seem sold on Musk's rationale.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told Business Insider that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit would be \"the biggest area that could impact Tesla.\"\n\n\"Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,\" Goldstein said. \"It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.\"\n\nGoldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has been struggling with.\n\nThe JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatened more than half of Tesla's 2025 profits.\n\nBrinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax and could result in a $1.2 billion headwind. He added that the automaker could face a $2 billion headwind from the removal of CARB ZEV credit sales, which encourage the sales of zero-emission vehicles.\n\nTesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its coming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. Brinkman said any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business was years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would most likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer,\" Brinkman wrote.\n\nGoldstein said the removal of the tax credit could \"accelerate\" Tesla's transition to an AI and robotics company.\n\nIt's also possible that the expiration of the EV tax credit on Tesla vehicles could spur some short-term demand from buyers looking to purchase one of the company's EVs before the window closes.\n\nTrump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.\n\nAs written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump entered the political scene.\n\nThe spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is \"growing like wildfire,\" by ending energy tax credits. The automaker's energy generation and storage business, which includes Tesla's Megapack and Powerwall battery systems , brought in $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 67% increase from the year prior.\n\nMusk shared a post on X from the official Tesla Energy account that said, \"Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid.\"\n\nTesla Energy also added that it was urging the Senate to enact legislation with a \"sensible wind down\" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing.\n\n\"This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who's a noted Tesla bull, told BI.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nXAI may benefit from AI regulation changes\n\nTrump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.\n\nOne section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI.\n\nThat could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down.\n\nThe bill also allocated funds toward modernizing the federal IT system with AI and improving the cybersecurity of its systems. With the government setting money aside to improve its systems, xAI, one of the companies at the forefront of the AI race, could be contracted to power the modernization efforts.",

        "content": "Mr. Musk’s time in government has been a decidedly mixed bag for his business empire. Tesla is particularly vulnerable after Mr. Musk’s popularity nose-dived when he slashed government jobs. Tesla dealerships became the target of protests as sales and profit fell. What’s more, the Republican budget bill now before the Senate would gut subsidies and policies that promote electric vehicles. Tesla’s stock has dropped about 14 percent this year, wiping around $180 billion off its market value.\n\nSome of Mr. Musk’s companies have benefited from his proximity to the White House, with Mr. Trump at one point promoting Tesla cars on the White House lawn and SpaceX harvesting more government tie-ups with Starlink, its satellite internet service. X remains a powerful megaphone for Mr. Musk’s and Mr. Trump’s supporters. And Mr. Trump is a valuable ally with policy power who oversees agencies that regulate Mr. Musk’s businesses.\n\nBut Mr. Musk is the face of his companies, and his protracted time in Washington has raised alarms over how committed he is to his businesses. Some former workers at SpaceX and elsewhere have questioned his absence from the companies. Overall, it’s unclear if the tech billionaire’s Washington maneuvers will lead to long-term advantages for them.\n\n“It became a mission critical thing to get the C.E.O. back in the office,” said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. “It’s not a moment too soon, quite frankly.”\n\nHow much time Mr. Musk will spend with his companies and outside Washington now remains unclear. At a news conference in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump on Friday, Mr. Musk called his departure from the government “not the end of DOGE but really the beginning” and said he would continue to visit “and be a friend and an adviser to the president.”",

        "content": "Billionaire Elon Musk blasted the massive tax and immigration bill at the heart of President Donald Trump’s agenda on Tuesday, calling the measure “a disgusting abomination” that would burden the country with “crushingly unsustainable debt.” Though Musk — who on Friday left his post as head of the U.S. DOGE Service, Trump’s cost-cutting effort — had previously criticized the bill in gentler terms, his posts on X, the social media platform he owns, represented his sharpest attack yet on the Trump White House. For months, Musk had played the role of the president’s “first buddy,” joining Trump frequently in the Oval Office and exhorting the administration to cut government spending.\n\nThe posts appeared to complicate the path to passage for the legislation, which barely passed the House late last month after conservatives revolted over its enormous price tag. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The Senate began consideration of the measure this week, and GOP leaders hope to have it to Trump’s desk by July 4. Trump has encouraged lawmakers to pass the measure, but some Republican Senate budget hawks applauded Musk’s attack Tuesday, a potential sign of trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”\n\nHe wrote minutes later: “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” That post appeared to confuse the annual deficit with the overall increase to the debt over 10 years.\n\nShortly after that, he wrote, “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”\n\nThe bill would extend tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term and make good on new campaign promises — including no taxes on tips or overtime wages — while devoting hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to defense and immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk’s attack landed while Senate Republicans huddled for a lunch with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who predicted robust economic growth if the legislation passes, lawmakers said. Many economists outside the White House disagree with that projection, arguing that rising national debt will crowd out private-sector investment.\n\nIn the Senate, lawmakers are haggling over whether to make additional budget cuts in the legislation — which would already slice more than $1 trillion from social safety net and anti-poverty programs — and to preserve some Biden-era clean energy initiatives, which would add to the bill’s cost.\n\nMainstream Republicans in the lunch meeting with Hassett greeted Musk’s posts with “an eyeball roll,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota) said.\n\n“We have a difference of opinion. He’s entitled to that opinion. We’re going to proceed full speed ahead,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for budget hawks — and Democrats — Musk provided a shot in the arm. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) called for splitting up Trump’s legislation into multiple smaller bills, saying one sweeping measure with such a large deficit hit couldn’t get the votes to pass the upper chamber.\n\n“I think Elon is exactly right that we need to cut more spending, and I hope and believe that the Senate will make the bill substantially better,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who interviewed Musk on his podcast in March and has described him as a friend.\n\nAsked how much more spending he would like to cut from the bill, Cruz said, “As much as humanly possible.”\n\nDemocrats enjoyed watching the GOP infighting.\n\n“I hear something happened while we were at lunch,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) joked while holding up a poster board of Musk’s tweets, “which led me to make some news here today and say something I didn’t think was imaginable: I agree with Elon Musk.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off Musk’s posts.\n\n“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” she said. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”\n\nThe legislation would undo most of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which poured federal tax incentives into production of electric vehicles, batteries and solar energy — cornerstones of Musk’s businesses. Tesla, in particular, suffered as Musk’s DOGE efforts became less popular: The EV maker reported a 71 percent plunge in profits in the first quarter. One person who has interacted with Musk over the years and closely followed his journey from Tesla to the White House said the bill could prompt frustrations with Republicans similar to Musk’s irritation with Democrats under the Biden administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It increases the deficit by trillions of dollars, kills solar and battery credits, sunsets battery production credits in 2028, kills the EV tax credit,” the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. “Elon and the Republicans were united in not liking the previous administration. As they get into governance, they are finding that is where the similarities end.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) pushed back on Musk’s criticism.\n\n“With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nThe speaker said that he and Musk talked about the legislation and other topics for 20 minutes Monday and that the two appeared to end the phone conversation on common ground.\n\n“Elon is missing it, okay?” Johnson added. “And it’s not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to him; that is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal. And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that. … But for him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing, very surprising, in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main focus of the legislation is extending parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first term, that are set to expire at the end of the year. Virtually every tax filer would pay more if the bill doesn’t pass. It would also devote $150 billion for immigration enforcement, another Trump administration priority.\n\nTo pay for the tax cut extensions, the bill would tighten eligibility for Medicaid, which the Congressional Budget Office says would leave millions of people uninsured. The bill would also pass on to states billions of dollars of expenses for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. That could lead local officials to sharply raise taxes or enact policies that kick families off SNAP.\n\nRepublicans also want to use some of the unilateral spending cuts made by Musk’s DOGE — which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, though it is not a Cabinet-level agency — to balance out the costs of the tax cuts. Many of those cuts are being challenged in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk on May 20 said he would stop spending on political causes and leave the White House to return to his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. He spent nearly $300 million, almost entirely on Republican candidates and causes, in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nFriday was his last day in the White House, and he and Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nFaiz Siddiqui, Mariana Alfaro, Liz Goodwin and Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren's office issued a report Tuesday chronicling Elon Musk's \"130 days\" in President Donald Trump's administration, accusing the billionaire of using his government perch to enrich himself and his businesses.\n\n\"Musk and individuals acting on his behalf have been involved in dozens of questionable actions that raise questions about corruption, ethics and conflicts of interest,\" says the report by the Massachusetts Democrat's office.\n\nThe 14-page report outlines more than 100 times that Warren's team believes Musk abused his role as a \"special government employee\" overseeing DOGE to benefit his private interests.\n\nIt accuses Musk of violating \"norms at an astonishing pace,\" actions that it calls \"scandalous behavior regardless of whether it subjects him to criminal prosecution.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on the report. CNBC also reached out for comment to Musk, his attorney Alex Spiro and Omead Afshar, a Tesla vice president. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk last week wrapped up his official government service leading the Department of Government Efficiency,\" which is engaged in a broad effort to slash federal government spending.\n\nHis four months leading DOGE as a special government employee were marked by unprecedented upheaval to the federal workforce and government agencies.",

        "content": "Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon\n\nWhy eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet\n\nMorgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be \"tempted to solve\" another \"problem\" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is \"commercialising air taxis,\" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, \"eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.\"Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.",

        "content": "Elon Musk’s brain tech startup Neuralink has closed a $650 million funding round, the company announced Monday.\n\nARK Invest, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and other firms participated in the round, according to a press release. Neuralink said the fresh capital will help the company bring its technology to more patients and develop new devices that “deepen the connection between biological and artificial intelligence.”\n\nNeuralink is building a brain-computer interface, or BCI, which is a system that translates brain signals into commands for external technologies.\n\nThe company’s first system, called Telepathy, involves 64 “threads” that are inserted directly into the brain. The threads are thinner than a human hair and record neural signals through 1,024 electrodes, according to Neuralink’s website.\n\nThe initial aim of the technology is to help patients with severe paralysis restore some independence. As of Monday, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink’s technology, and are able to “control digital and physical devices with their thoughts,” the release said.\n\nNeuralink is currently carrying out four separate clinical trials around its Telepathy system.\n\nBCIs have been studied in academia for decades, and several other companies, including Synchron, Paradromics and Precision Neuroscience, are developing their own systems.\n\nParadromics on Monday announced it successfully implanted its BCI in a human for the first time.\n\nIt’s not clear what devices Neuralink will look to develop next, but Musk has for years espoused grand ambitions for the brain tech startup. He has even claimed that he would be willing to get an implant himself.\n\nOne of the capabilities Musk has repeatedly highlighted is the ability to restore vision to blind patients.\n\nNeuralink received a “Breakthrough Device” designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a device called Blindsight. This designation is granted to medical devices that have the potential to provide improved treatment for debilitating or life-threatening conditions.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform X in September, Musk said Blindsight will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see.\n\nNeuralink still has a long road ahead before it can commercialize these technologies.",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nTesla makes EVs, batteries, robots, and startups.\n\nA steady stream of employees — the \"Tesla mafia\" — have left to found companies in everything from EVs and batteries to robotics and electric boats.\n\nElectric car startup Lucid was founded by former Tesla executives back in 2007, and the ex-Tesla founders of British EV startup Longbow previously told Business Insider they aimed to deliver a Roadster sports car before Elon Musk's company.\n\nFormer senior employees who then raised large amounts for their own startups include former senior vice president of energy Drew Baglino, whose energy firm Heron Power reportedly raised a Series A round of over $30 million in April. Automotive tech startup Tekion, founded by Tesla's former chief information officer Jay Vijayan, is now valued at over $4 billion.\n\n\"The success rate of former Tesla employees starting their own companies, building hard things, is exceptionally high,\" Chris Walti, Tesla's former Optimus lead, told BI.\n\nBI spoke to Walti and two other former Tesla employees about why so many of its former employees have gone on to startup success.\n\n'It's not a Google-like culture, and it's not a 9-to-5 experience'\n\nGene Berdichevsky, CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies and Tesla's seventh ever employee, said what sets working at the company apart is the sense of \"radical self-reliance.\"\n\n\"It's kind of the belief that when you're doing new things, there are no experts to ask, there are no suppliers who have done it before. If there are, you're probably not doing something particularly novel,\" said Berdichevsky, who left the company in 2008.\n\nWalti, who left the company in 2022 after seven years to start robotics firm Mytra, told BI that Tesla gave engineers unprecedented freedom and responsibility to tackle \"really big problems.\"\n\n\"You can solve problems without requiring 20 product managers and five VPs for approval. Here's the problem: go figure it out, go solve it, go talk to whoever you need to get it done,\" Walti said.\n\nSila Nanotechnologies CEO Gene Berdichevsky was Tesla's seventh ever employee. Sila Nanotechnologies\n\nWhile Tesla's lack of bureaucracy may be liberating, the company is also known for its intense work culture.\n\nMusk and other senior figures have previously slept on the factory floor during crises, and employees are expected to work long hours to meet the billionaires' tight deadlines.\n\n\"Tesla is not an easy place to work, but it was never intended to be. It's not a Google-like culture, and it's not a 9-to-5 experience,\" said Berdichevsky.\n\nWalti said Tesla employees used to jokingly warn each other not to \"fly too close to the sun,\" with Musk having little tolerance for failure.\n\n\"Elon has a short fuse. It doesn't matter how many successful projects you've delivered,\" he said. \"You screw up once and you might be out.\"\n\nWalti added that the intensity of working with Musk led some people to \"burn out,\" and said that working in a system where employees had little say over product direction could be frustrating.\n\n\"If you're not too close to the sun, it's a wonderful place to work because you get to work on really meaty problems. You get the innovation, the scale, the tech risk, and you're surrounded by a bunch of really innovative people,\" he said.\n\nChris Walti led Tesla's robotics team and spearheaded development of the company's Optimus robot. Mytra\n\n\"On the flip side, it doesn't give you a lot of agency over why you're building things. You'll be told 'make the Cybertruck float,' and at no point is there a debate on why; it was like, just go do it,\" Walti added.\n\nLeaving Tesla\n\nTobias Kahnert, who founded powertrain startup EFT Mobility, said that starting a new company is often more attractive than taking a job at a rival for Tesla employees.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"We used to call it internally 'the Mount Everest syndrome',\" said Tobias Kahnert, who was a senior software engineer at Tesla from 2014 to 2017.\n\nKahnert joined Tesla right out of college and worked there through the \"production hell\" of ramping the Model 3 mass-market EV. The idea of founding his own company felt like a natural next move, he said.\n\n\"I couldn't see a more exciting company in the world at that point\" than Tesla, he said. \"The option was either I stay with that company until retirement, which is a long time away, or I start something myself,\" he said.\n\nKahnert said the most valuable lesson he learned at Tesla was how to innovate quickly without losing track of the need to scale a product.\n\n\"The stretch between these two worlds is something you learn quite quickly at Tesla. You need this spirit of challenging the norms, seeing what's possible, and figuring out ways to get it done without being bogged down too much in processes,\" said Kahnert.\n\nTobias Kahnert worked as a senior software engineer during Tesla's Model 3 production ramp. Electric Flytrain\n\n\"But you also actually need to get on the level of working with the process and alongside regulations to even have a product that you can bring into the market,\" he added.\n\nWalti said Tesla offered a unique experience within engineering of building hard things at scale on a tight timeline, which he called a \"trifecta\" of speed, scale, and innovation.\n\n\"Usually, you have to pick two of the three. At places like Boeing or Lockheed, you're building hard things with innovation, but the timelines are, like, 10 years,\" said Walti.\n\n\"Tesla is a unique place because of the scale. Startups are fast and innovative, but not yet scaled. Innovating with speed at scale is an interesting nexus that really accelerates learning,\" he added.\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nGood morning! Doing one thing every day that makes you smarter is a good goal to have. Here's my suggestion for today: Subscribe to BI Tech Memo . Alistair Barr is the best in the biz at breaking down what's going on in Big Tech. (And it's free!)\n\nIn today's big story, Elon Musk had some not-so-nice things to say about President Donald Trump's tax bill.\n\nWhat's on deck\n\nMarkets: They might be in secondaries, but they're still on top. Meet the key execs in Wall Street's hottest market .\n\nTech: What a top Microsoft exec learned from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy .\n\nBusiness: Florida real estate is showing cracks , and it could be a red flag for the rest of the country.\n\nBut first, I just can't stand it anymore.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nElon has something to say\n\nAllison Robbert / AFP via Getty Images\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Elon Musk doesn't see anything pretty in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThe billionaire railed against President Donald Trump's tax bill Tuesday afternoon, calling it a \" disgusting abomination .\"\n\nMusk, known for keeping his opinions to himself, posted on X that he \"just can't stand it anymore,\" before criticizing the \"massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.\"\n\n\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he added.\n\nHe's not the only one attacking Trump's bill. Some within the president's own party have gone after it for fueling the government's growing deficit .\n\nChris Unger/Getty Images\n\nSo what's behind Musk's outburst?\n\nWe're less than a week removed from his decision to leave Washington . Why jump back into the fray?\n\nHere's what could be rubbing him the wrong way about the bill:\n\nDOGE disappointment: According to one estimate, Trump's tax bill will increase the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's probably a difficult pill to swallow for Musk, who was tasked with cutting that down via DOGE.\n\nThe group took extreme measures trying to achieve that, and Musk faced plenty of professional and personal backlash. Now he's seeing the tax bill \"undermine\" — his words, not mine — all of that work.\n\nMusk Inc. and the tax bill: Despite his recent foray into politics, Musk is still a business owner at heart. Trump's tax bill has real implications for his companies, both good (SpaceX) and bad (Tesla). BI's Ana Altchek, Alice Tecotzky and Kelsey Vlamis have a breakdown on what it means for his portfolio .\n\nThe end of a friendship: Since the Trump-Musk bromance first blossomed, people have speculated when it might end. As BI's Peter Kafka put it shortly after the election , \"both men are famously short-fused\" and \"adore the spotlight.\"\n\n\"And that combination makes it easy to imagine a break-up down the line,\" Peter added.\n\nWe've seen cracks in the relationship before. The dustup over the government funding bill led to jokes about Musk being the real leader of the GOP. That elicited a response from a Trump spokesperson . Musk also clashed with Trump's base over H-1B visas .\n\nJust Elon being Elon: Sometimes the best explanation is the simplest. Musk has a history of shooting from the hip with his takes. (Being the richest person in the world affords you that privilege.) He's already said that he and Trump didn't always see eye to eye . This could just be another example of that.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nI-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\n1. The Nvidia hype is back. The chip giant's stock has climbed 20% over the last month. After bottoming in April during a broader market sell-off, Nvidia's stock is now up 45%. These are four big catalysts spurring it on.\n\n2. Six Wall Street veterans on the best trades they've ever made. Senior money managers told BI about the highlights of their investing careers, from buying undervalued stocks to making well-timed exits. One talked about shorting GameStop .\n\n3. Power players in secondaries. The secondaries market — in which investors buy and sell secondhand shares of private funds — is on pace to break last year's record highs of $160 billion. Meet 14 people who took the industry from niche to new heights.\n\n3 things in tech\n\nHarry Murphy/Sportsfile for Web Summit via Getty Images\n\n1. How can you make AI your coworker, not your replacement? The HR-tech startup Lattice thinks it has the answer. The CEO of the company, which makes AI agents for the workplace, told BI that embracing AI now would help protect jobs , not threaten them.\n\n2. Microsoft's copycat strategy. The company's latest exec Jay Parikh is adopting Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's strategies for his new AI organization, Core AI, according to an internal email viewed by BI. Parikh shared takeaways from an annual letter Jassy sent to Amazon shareholders in a memo. Here are three of his takeaways .\n\n3. The pure internet is gone. Did anyone save a copy? Since ChatGPT came out, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. That's sent researchers diving deep to preserve content made by humans prior to 2022, BI's Alistair Barr writes .\n\n3 things in business\n\nFound Image Holdings/Corbis via Getty Images; Rebecca Zisser/BI\n\n1. Trouble in paradise. Florida was the undisputed winner of the pandemic relocation boom, luring millions of new residents with its beaches and low taxes. Now, Floridians are experiencing an affordability crisis, hurricane-fueled insurance nightmares, and more. It's also a warning for America's real-estate market .\n\n2. A business immigration lawyer on Trump 2.0. The Trump administration is being as strict as possible when it comes to work-visa applications, attorney Jason Finkelman told BI. With the amount of effort and hoops to jump through, Finkelman believes it's designed to frustrate US companies into giving up on hiring foreign workers .\n\n3. This longtime middle manager supports flattening middle management. Alvaro Munevar Jr. told BI he'd seen middle management practices that siloed workers and slowed productivity . But as Big Tech culls those roles, the remaining ones could still evolve significantly. A LinkedIn executive said managers will need to be more like coaches to keep teams' energy up.\n\nIn other news\n\nWhat's happening today\n\nUS doubles tariff on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.\n\nSentencing for man convicted of murder in fatal stabbing of Cash App founder Bill Lee.\n\nThe Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Therefore, Mexico will no longer face 50% tariffs, and those affected by tariffs of this magnitude from Mexico will be reimbursed.\n\nThe proclamation seeks to reduce the impact on the US automotive industry by allowing companies with factories in the US to access tariff discounts on foreign parts for two years based on the quantity and price of cars assembled and sold in the US.\n\nThere are no changes to the tariff items considered or to the individual 25% tariff, but the elimination of tariff accumulation reduces the weighted average tariff from 18.2% to 13.9%.\n\nThese actions reinforce our hypothesis that an equilibrium will be reached in which the level of protectionism toward Mexico will be lower than that applied to the rest of the world, due to the complementarities and integration in value chains that contribute to greater US competitiveness.",

If the renewed debate on protectionism helps India understand that its trade policies are self-defeating, Trump might end up doing India, and the world, a huge favor.\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump announced sweeping and unprecedented tariffs on U.S. trading partners, intensifying global economic uncertainty and triggering a sharp stock market decline in the United States and elsewhere. At the same time, China continues to face headwinds from the global “China+1” strategy, as countries seek to diversify their supply chains and reduce dependence on Chinese manufacturing—a concern that has grown with the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. India should seize this moment to set a bold new ambition: to become a more reliable trading partner to the world than either China or the United States. Its size and long-term potential lend credibility to such a vision. Realizing it, though, will require a fundamental rethinking and overhaul of India’s trade policy approach.\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump announced sweeping and unprecedented tariffs on U.S. trading partners, intensifying global economic uncertainty and triggering a sharp stock market decline in the United States and elsewhere.

Its size and long-term potential lend credibility to such a vision. Realizing it, though, will require a fundamental rethinking and overhaul of India’s trade policy approach.\n\nTrump has frequently called out India as the world’s “tariff king,” and this is not far from the truth. India is a tariff outlier. If the renewed debate on protectionism helps India understand that its trade policies are self-defeating, Trump might end up doing India, and the world, a huge favor.\n\nTrump’s tariffs have been labeled by economist Paul Krugman as the “biggest trade shock in history.” Including all tariff changes announced as of mid-May, average effective tariffs in the United States—the world’s largest importing country—are calculated at 17.8 percent (assuming the share of countries in U.S. imports remains the same) or 16.4 percent (after assuming shifts in demand to lower tariff countries). The latter is the highest rate since 1937.\n\nThese actions are roiling the world economy, leading to retaliation by some partners—especially China—and pushing the rest of the world to find other sources of demand. This is, in turn, accelerating negotiations on trade partnerships that do not involve the United States. Most countries will also intensify efforts to preserve and reform the rules-based international trading system. Irrespective of how the future tariff landscape evolves, the “uncertainty tax” on business has dramatically increased since November 2024: A global index of economic uncertainty was already higher in January 2025 than at any time since 1997 and would certainly have increased further since then (and the International Monetary Fund says trade policy uncertainty is “off the charts”).\n\nWhile demand-side diversification strategies away from the United States are a recent phenomenon, efforts to diversify supply chains away from China have existed since the 2000s, gaining significant traction during the first round of the U.S.-China trade wars and during the COVID-19 pandemic. China has not helped its case by weaponizing trade to score political points: Examples include restricting rare-earth exports to Japan owing to contestation about the Senkaku Islands (which China calls the Diaoyu) and cutting demand from Australia after it called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19. China’s ongoing trade war, which has intensified further after it announced retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. levies, and a more general export control on rare earths also make countries wary of getting involved in the crossfire. Finally, China’s opaque export subsidies have made it a frequent target of anti-dumping duties and prompted efforts to find other supply sources.\n\nIt seems the stage is set for the world’s most populous country to take on a more prominent role in world trade. But India is being held back by a diffident approach to trade. Between 2015 and 2022, India’s simple average tariffs rose from 13.4 to 18.1 percent. Despite declining to 17 percent in 2023, its tariffs rates are significantly higher than those of countries with which it is competing for a share of the China+1 pie: Vietnam’s average tariff is 9.4 percent, and other Southeast Asian competitors fall in the 8-10 percent range. India’s elevated tariffs—particularly high on many final goods such as automobiles and apparel—raise costs for exporters and consumers and encourage firms to sell into the protected domestic market. High tariffs have also rendered India vulnerable to World Trade Organization complaints by partners.\n\nMoreover, after 2022, India has seen a spurt in quality control orders, or QCOs: quality standards that must be met by domestic and foreign producers. These QCOs, now covering more than 100 sectors, are often opaque, incentivize lobbying, and lead to significant delays in import clearances; economists call these “nontariff barriers.”\n\nThis rise in protection harks back to India’s past. After independence in 1947, India’s leaders opted for import substitution industrialization, a strategy based on high import protection—invoking the infant industry argument—and a leading role for the state in the “commanding heights” of the economy, such as capital goods and other core sectors such as steel, chemicals, and trucks. This economic nationalism was a reaction to the British Empire’s open economy approach and was nurtured for more than four decades by the Indian National Congress party, whose leaders led the independence struggle.\n\nBut the recent rise in import barriers—aimed at promoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” initiative and reviving a manufacturing sector in decline relative to the rest of the economy—ignores the lessons of India’s post-1991 economic success, when a macroeconomic crisis gave India’s policymakers the political space to liberalize onerous trade, industrial, financial, and foreign exchange policies. Average tariffs were steadily reduced from 81 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 1997 and 9 percent by 2010. The impact on trade was conspicuous: Goods trade rose from 11 percent of GDP in 1988 to a peak of 43 percent in 2012.\n\nIn the last decade, as Indian tariffs rose, Vietnam—a country with just 7 percent of India’s population—has become a serious competitor. It already exports more manufactured goods than its much larger Asian counterpart. Both countries import significant quantities of chemicals as production inputs. But Vietnam’s average import duty on chemicals is just 3 percent, compared with 10.3 percent in India. Moreover, more than 50 percent of chemicals enter Vietnam duty-free, whereas in India, this figure is a mere 0.2 percent. This pattern holds across other key inputs, meaning that Indian firms consistently pay higher costs for raw materials than Vietnamese competitors, making it significantly harder for them to compete in global markets.\n\nIndia’s tariff regime has also been a major roadblock in its efforts to secure comprehensive free trade agreements, or FTAs, with key trading partners. For example, its negotiations with the European Union, which began in 2007, have not yet reached a conclusion, largely due to disagreements over tariff reductions. While India has signed trade agreements with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, these are “early harvest” deals that fall short of the commitments found in comprehensive FTAs. The failure to secure comprehensive trade agreements has significant implications for India’s export growth. Vietnam, by contrast, has signed FTAs with both the EU and U.K., enabling Vietnamese firms to enjoy important preference margins over their Indian counterparts—in garments, for instance, the duty differential could be as high as 12 percent.\n\nHigh tariffs and other trade barriers also reduce domestic market competition and create incentives for protectionism to persist. Low tariffs can discipline rent-seeking behavior by large firms and are important in a context where industrial concentration is rising: The share of the largest five business groups in India’s nonfinancial sector rose from 10 percent in 1991 to nearly 18 percent in 2021. The discipline imposed by low tariffs was missing in India, where tariffs rose between 2015 and 2022.\n\nTrump announced a 26 percent tariff rate on India as part of his April 2 announcements, even as the two sides are pursuing an early closure to a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) by later this year. India is hoping, especially with the 90-day pause, that a concluded BTA will help it sidestep the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States.\n\nYet the most important and positive long-term fallout may be more consequential than any BTA that New Delhi and Washington sign. For India, rethinking its approach to trade is not about appeasing Trump—it is about fixing a system that undermines its export potential, weakens its position as a serious China+1 contender, limits its ability to secure comprehensive FTAs, and obstructs its broader economic ambitions.\n\nIn fact, there is growing recognition about the negative impact of India’s trade policies and its missed opportunities, prompting calls for a reexamination of its tariff and nontariff barriers. Perhaps Indian officials are also beginning to recognize this. On May 6, India and the U.K. concluded talks on an FTA that was in the works since 2022. It is the most ambitious deal that India has signed with any country so far.\n\nThe rest of the world has a deep stake in India’s economic potential. The United States remains the world’s biggest consumer, accounting for 13 percent of world demand for imported goods, although this share has declined from 18.9 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, since the start of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018, China’s share in world goods exports has only grown, from 12.7 percent in 2017 to 14.1 percent in 2023.\n\nIndia, with its size, youthful population, and large human resource base, has been called an obvious “plus one” in the China+1 space. India has undoubted potential to increase its low share of 1.8 percent (worth $432 billion) in world goods exports and 2.8 percent ($672 billion) in world goods imports. For example, its goods trade share of GDP was only 31 percent in 2023, compared with China’s trade peak of 64 percent of GDP in 2006, suggesting much room for trade to grow. A forthcoming paper by my colleagues T.G. Srinivasan, Baran Pradhan, and me at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress shows that in 2022, India’s goods exports could have been higher by $440 billion-$516 billion and goods imports higher by $244 billion-$301 billion. Adding these numbers to actual figures for 2022 would bring India’s goods trade close to $1 trillion each in exports and imports.\n\nDespite the possibly temporary U.S.-China trade truce, the world economy has already witnessed significant damage, with more to come. Countries are looking for bilateral deals with partners that commit to the spirit of open and predictable trade policies—and this involves a search for more reliable sources of supply as well as demand. On both counts, India can rise to the occasion, provided it abandons its protectionist instincts.",

        "content": "International trade is going through a much-needed reset. Several major countries, most notably the United States with its dramatic announcement last week, are shifting their approaches to trade, often in more protectionist directions. But it would be a mistake to view the events of recent months in isolation. To get the full picture, it’s necessary to start much earlier and examine the larger, and in some ways more profound, changes in global trade that have led up to this moment. At the same time, while a reset in trade is necessary today, a successful reset is unlikely to be achieved by focusing only on market access or exports of manufactured goods.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank published a report on how trade deals have moved away from older-style preferential trade agreements to so-called “deep trade” agreements, which go far beyond tariff barriers or market access. These “deep trade” agreements, as former Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Pascal Lamy explained, are “about regulatory measures and other so-called non-tariff measures that were once the exclusive domain of domestic policy making.” These agreements “cover policy areas such as competition, subsidies, and regulatory standards,” and they go beyond conventional border measures to “regulate the behaviour of the exporting and importing government.”\n\nFast forward to today, and the global trade scene is very different from just five years ago. As the World Bank’s website summarizes the shift: “Powerful protectionist forces have begun to challenge the global community’s commitment to open trade; many advanced economies blame trade for job losses as manufacturing and some services shift to lower-cost destinations.”\n\nToday, the United States, once an international advocate for open trade and competitiveness, is turning toward a more protectionist model of trade, announcing tariff and nontariff barriers and limiting market access—trade policies more commonly associated developing economies. It’s too early to predict how this will unfold, but some aspects of this global phenomenon have already come into focus.\n\nThe reasons for the change\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the volume of global exports and the number of international trade agreements rapidly increased. In much of the period since then, trade negotiations were managed between policymakers and seasoned bureaucrats, all working toward ensuring ease for the domestic consumer. Much of this work was done away from substantial public attention. Trade negotiations today, however, are too often loud political undertakings, used as either a coercion mechanism or a friendly gesture. The past few US administrations, several Latin American governments, and several Southeast Asian governments have tried to negotiate trade deals that are “worker-centered” and have attempted to advance trends such as “friend-shoring” or near-shoring, as many corporations planned to diversify their supply chains away from China.\n\nWhile the specter of China influenced this pivot, there was also an emphasis on modernizing manufacturing with more sophisticated technology. What was overlooked in this process, though, is the legitimate reason why advanced economies lost their competitive advantage in manufacturing to emerging economies. As economist Jagdish N. Bhagwati explained in 1982,\n\nthe pressure of import competition . . . can be seen as being addressed to industries undergoing a basic shift in comparative advantage, not because of technological advances arising in different parts of the world which are not being shared by competing nations, but rather because of shifts in labour costs or because “learning by doing” by latecomers is altering the traditional competitive edge of industries in the West.\n\nLabor-intensive industries are increasingly demonstrating comparative advantage in emerging economies, as they are compatible with capital intensity.\n\nAs capital-intensive industries are at a comparative advantage with emerging economies, technological advancements leading to digital trade are creating an advantage for Western economies. Digital commerce allows firms of all sizes, anywhere in the world, to gain access to new markets. But many emerging economies, although catching up fast, still lack the basics required for digital trade or even trade in services. These barriers can vary from inadequate infrastructure and regulatory uncertainty to data localization rules that restrict cross-border data flows.\n\nDigital trade plays a larger role than ever in the global economy. With an 8.1 percent average annual growth rate for almost two decades, it has outpaced other categories, such as goods trade. Yet this does not benefit all economies equally. International cooperation is crucial to promoting common and universal laws on digital trade as a precondition for it to grow and deliver more broadly shared benefits. But that will require building consensus on such rules.\n\nA pivot away from the WTO\n\nTraditionally, the role of consensus building has been played by multilateral organizations such as the WTO. But for the past three decades, the WTO has experienced a slow and steady decline in its influence as it has consistently faltered at its primary role of maintaining a rule-based trading system, ensuring predictability, and encouraging its member countries to make tariff adjustments in line with their economic development. One of the reasons for its decline is that the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism has not been functioning up to its potential due to the blocking—mainly by the United States—of appointments to its appellate body, leading to a paralysis of the appeals process and leaving trade disputes unresolved. In addition, many of the member countries refuse to let go of their self-declared “developing economies” status and continue to claim subsidies, which has further sowed discontent among developed economies.\n\nDespite these issues, no member has exited the WTO since its inception in 1995. Since the WTO assures market access and reprimands discriminatory trade practices, it would be unwise for any member to exit. One of the WTO’s recent successes came when it waived off certain patent restrictions to ensure the accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGiven the movement of labor-intensive jobs to developing economies, advanced Western economies’ domination of digital trade, and the disarmament of the WTO, most economies have started pivoting toward protectionist trade practices that are designed to restrict imports and promote domestic industries instead. Each nation is now pursuing its own political agenda, mistakenly believing that protectionist actions will bring economic benefits. Some are implementing soft protectionism, such as subsidies for favored industries. Others are implementing all-out protectionist policies. Meanwhile, rhetoric about geopolitical threats—often China—is used to garner support for preferential trade deals.\n\nThe rise of preferential trade agreements\n\nAs a result of the forces outlined above, preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are becoming the norm globally as an alternative arrangement to keep trade predictable and for economies to defend themselves against lawlessness. This is encouraging regionalism and fragmented trading practices, which often leads to fierce disagreements. As Bhagwati argued in 2008, “With PTAs proliferating, the trading system can then be expected to become chaotic.” A situation ensues in which there are “[c]risscrossing PTAs, where a nation had multiple PTAs with other nations, each of which then had its own PTAs with yet other nations . . . Indeed, if one only mapped the phenomenon, it would remind one of a child scrawling a number of chaotic lines on a sketch pad.”\n\nThe last decade has seen some significant preferential trade agreements ratified or at least signed. Significant among them are the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the African Continental Free Trade Area, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Countries in such regional preferential trade agreements account for about 78 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.\n\nHowever, what is concerning is that the three most important traders—China, the United States, and the European Union—have been unable to negotiate any trade agreements among themselves. Each of the three economies sees the others as sources of significant competition instead of comparative advantage. Regional trade agreements naturally exclude the economies that are not part of the bloc.\n\nYet, the interdependence on other markets is evident from 2021 trading data, which shows that 70 percent of North America’s exports, 41 percent of Asia’s, and 31 percent of Europe’s went outside their respective regions, while Africa and Latin America depend on other regions for 85 percent of their exports. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic starkly revealed how interconnected—and therefore vulnerable—global trade is. Supply chain shocks during the pandemic encouraged many countries and companies to hedge their risks.\n\nWhere global trade goes from here\n\nThis global trade reset cannot be achieved by focusing only on market access or exports of manufactured goods. Nor can it be achieved by signing regional trade agreements. Instead, the next chapter of global trade should rely on a new set of priorities that enhance a collective sense of security.\n\nWhat would this look like? This new era should include trade policies that advance economic interests as well as geopolitical interests. Governments should pursue climate and energy security, a digital economy that has universally agreed artificial intelligence regulations, and supply chains that are not dependent on one source alone. Resets are never easy in the short term, but they are an unavoidable phenomenon. In the best-case scenario, today’s global trade turmoil may lead to tomorrow’s renaissance.\n\nRidhika Batra is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: A worker walks past a container ship at Mundra Port in the western Indian state of Gujarat April 1, 2014.

        "content": "While Donald Trump has modeled his policies on those imposed by the former US president William McKinley (1843-1901), whom he lauds as the \"king of tariffs\" for imposing 50% tariffs, he has ignored the fact that today's global economy is completely different from that at the end of the 19thcentury. At that time, trade accounted for 10% of the global GDP as opposed to 25% today. Supply chains now span the entire planet and no longer revolve around the Rust Belt in the northeastern United States as they did a century ago.\n\nTrump's tariff protectionism is therefore an unprecedented shock; the consequences of which are difficult to gauge, particularly as reciprocal tariffs considered by the US president will put an end to a system built at the end of the Second World War that, precisely to avoid geopolitical tensions, was based on non-discrimination with all countries being tariffed equally.\n\nWhat will tomorrow's global trade landscape look like? On February 18, Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, cited two dangers: \"Higher US tariffs on Chinese products will redirect Chinese overcapacity towards Europe, further hitting European firms,\" he said. Indeed, larger EU companies are more concerned about this effect than the loss of access to the US market.\"\n\nChina's exports are growing at three times the rate of world trade and propelling its trade surplus to record heights. It has overtaken its GDP threshold of 10% in 2024 and is approaching the record figure of 12% which it had reached before the 2008 financial crisis. It is a tsunami that has already damaged German industry, which is losing its market share in the automotive, cleantech and civil aviation sectors and according to a study by the think-tank Centre for European Reform, published in mid-January, \"China's macroeconomic imbalances now directly infringe on German industrial interests.\"\n\n## Investment announcements\n\nAnd the trend is likely to speed up. Several Chinese manufacturers, who were interviewed by Reuters, are preparing to reduce their profit margins and embark on \"a rush\" to conquer other markets to compensate for their falling sales in the US.\n\n**You have 39.31% of this article left to read.

        "content": "President Donald Trump's tariff policies have significantly harmed the United States economy, burdening American consumers, businesses and workers while dramatically failing to achieve their intended goals.\n\nDespite Trump's bold assertions that tariffs would rejuvenate American industry and restore fairness in global trade, economic research unequivocally demonstrates that these policies have backfired, imposing significant and lasting economic damage on the nation.\n\nAt their core, tariffs function as direct taxes on American consumers, raising the cost of imported goods and ultimately hitting the wallets of working and middle-class families hardest. Trump's first round of tariffs in 2019 led to an annual cost increase of approximately $831 per household , according to economists at the New York Federal Reserve. This price surge disproportionately impacts lower-income families, undermining their financial security and increasing economic inequality.\n\nIn 2025, Trump escalated his tariff strategy dramatically by declaring trade deficits a national emergency. He imposed an unprecedented 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imported goods, accompanied by significantly higher tariffs on key trade partners such as China, Mexico and the European Union. Rather than stabilizing the economy by creating jobs, this escalation immediately spiked consumer prices for everyday goods and essentials — whether it be food prices or clothing and textiles — exacerbating inflationary pressures and placing even greater financial stress on American households.\n\nThe damage extends far beyond rising consumer costs. Trump's aggressive tariff policies have provoked retaliatory actions from other nations, severely harming U.S. exporters, particularly in the agricultural sector. Retaliatory tariffs from China resulted in annual losses exceeding $10 billion for American farmers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Soybean exports, once a cornerstone of U.S. agriculture, plummeted, forcing many farmers to rely heavily on government subsidies rather than market-driven revenues.\n\nAdditionally, industries beyond agriculture, such as technology and automotive sectors, faced severe disruptions due to retaliatory tariffs and increased input costs. Companies have been forced either to absorb higher costs, thus reducing profitability and investment potential, or pass these costs on to consumers, further driving inflation.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, heavily championed by Trump as a beneficiary of his tariffs, has also suffered substantial setbacks. A comprehensive 2020 Federal Reserve study confirmed that manufacturing employment actually declined in industries dependent on imported components due to rising production costs, decreased global competitiveness and weakened demand.\n\nMoreover, Trump's unpredictable tariff approach has injected damaging uncertainty into the U.S. economy. This unpredictability deters business investment and slows economic growth. Harvard Business Review highlights how companies have delayed or canceled investment plans in response to unpredictable trade policy shifts, hindering innovation and job creation. Perhaps most striking is Trump's complete failure to address the very trade deficits his tariffs sought to reduce. A report by The Commerce Department revealed that the U.S. trade deficit not only persisted but widened during Trump's administration. Far from strengthening America's economic position, Trump's protectionist stance has isolated the U.S. internationally, eroding trust and damaging relationships with vital trading partners, such as Mexico, China and the European Union.\n\nBy pursuing a confrontational stance rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, Trump’s tariffs have diminished America’s ability to influence global economic standards positively. Our allies abroad have increasingly begun to view the U.S. as an unreliable partner, weakening America's strategic economic position globally.\n\nUltimately, Trump's tariffs represent an economically indefensible policy driven more by political symbolism than genuine economic rationale. They punish American families, damage key industries and fail to achieve even the basic objectives of job creation and trade deficit reduction. The economic costs far outweigh any perceived benefits.\n\nMoving forward, policymakers must decisively reject Trump's protectionist approach. Returning to evidence-based international trade practices is crucial for America's economic recovery and long-term prosperity. By abandoning harmful tariffs, the U.S. can restore consumer purchasing power, stimulate business investment and reestablish itself as a reliable and respected trade partner.\n\nOwen Puckett is an Opinion Editor and a member of the Editorial Board.

        "content": "Our Strategy Consulting teams help CEOs achieve maximum value for stakeholders by designing strategies that improve profitability and long-term value.\n\nWhat other tariffs were announced?\n\nThe administration confirmed it is imposing automotive tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act (for which the original investigation concluded in February 2019), starting on April 3, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe 25% tariff affects imported passenger vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans and cargo vans, and light trucks. Key automobile parts such as engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components also fall under the tariff.\n\nThe US imported a total of US$247b of motor vehicles in 2024 plus US$143b of automotive parts. Assuming 90% of Canadian auto imports would eventually become USMCA-compliant and 95% of Mexican auto imports would become USMCA-compliant, that would represent a total of nearly US$300b of imports subject to the tariffs.\n\nAssuming the tariffs are permanent, we estimate their impact to be a loss of 0.3% of GDP relative to a baseline in 2025, and a loss of 0.4% of GDP relative to a baseline in 2026. The impact on Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation would +0.2% in 2025. For the EU, Canada and Mexico, the GDP loss relative to the baseline would be 0.1% in 2025 and 0.4% in 2026. For Japan, it would be 0.1% in 2025 and 0.3% in 2026. For mainland China, it would be 0.1% and 0.2% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nWhat would the impact be of ending the ‘de minimis’ exemption for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong?\n\n\n\nPresident Trump is ending duty-free de minimis treatment for covered goods from mainland China and Hong Kong. Starting May 2, these goods will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or US$25 per item (increasing to US$50 per item after June 1, 2025).\n\nThe de minimis tariff exemption allows shipments bound for US businesses and consumers valued under US$800 (per person, per day) to enter the US free of duty and taxes. In 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimated a total of over 1 billion such shipments worth around US$54b entered the US if shipped through the international postal network. Covered goods shipped from mainland China and Hong Kong are subject to the reciprocal duties and all other applicable duties.\n\nWhile the total value of these shipments is modest compared to total US imports of over US$3t, research suggests that the elimination of the de minimis exemption would lead to a reduction in aggregate welfare around US$12b, disproportionately hurting lower-income consumers. Since roughly US$18b of de minimis shipments come from mainland China, mostly via e-commerce platforms, we estimate the loss of welfare from eliminating the mainland China exemption to represent around US$4b.\n\nWhat will the impact be on our baseline forecast and what are the recession odds?\n\nAs described above, our initial assessment of the economic impact of the new tariff measures points to a substantial hit to the US and global economy, with consumer spending possibly retrenching and a risk that the economy could fall into a recession.\n\nOn the growth front, the US economy could enter a recession in the second half of the year with a real GDP growth drag averaging 0.8ppt in 2025, bringing our average growth forecast from 1.5% down to 0.7%. By Q4 2025, real GDP could be contracting 0.5% y/y.\n\nOn the inflation front, the new reciprocal tariffs could raise US consumer price inflation by 0.8ppt by Q4 2025, with the inflationary impulse concentrated in the second quarter of the year.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the new tariffs and potential retaliation measures from targeted economies, we will adjust our baseline in the coming week to account for the latest developments. One thing is for sure though, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has risen from 40% just two weeks ago to around 60% today.\n\nHow will the Fed react?\n\n\n\nFed policymakers will maintain a reactionary stance in the coming month and will want to avoid front-running the impact of tariffs on output and inflation. We will likely see a growing fracture between those that are more concerned about the negative impact of tariffs on growth and employment and those more concerned about the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and persistently higher inflation.\n\nHow much certainty do we have about the permanence and breadth of these tariffs?\n\n\n\nThere will be latent uncertainty in the coming months surrounding the breadth of the tariffs and their duration. In terms of breadth, the administration has already started discussing the possibility of exemptions and exclusions at the country and sector levels. We will be producing a follow-up note with product-level analysis using the EY UPGRADE CGE model.\n\nSimilarly, we shouldn’t discount the possibility of some tariffs being imposed for a short period and then removed or reduced. Many economies have already begun to seek negotiations with the Trump administration to lower the tariffs.\n\nOn the flip side, it remains to be seen how the US administration will address certain products like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, energy and critical minerals that were excluded from the recent tariff announcements but have been identified by President Trump as targets for future sectoral tariffs.\n\nWhat is the risk for US consumers and businesses?\n\n\n\nBeyond immediate cost pressures, higher tariffs will undermine corporate and household sentiment on the economy while diverting production resources to resilience building. With consumers and businesses increasingly worried about the economic outlook, a wait-and-see approach is likely to be favored, and both groups could scale back future spending and investment intentions. This is particularly true as trade uncertainty has fed market volatility, with the US equity market underperforming. The ensuing negative wealth effect is likely to further constrain business investment and consumer spending.\n\nTo offset both the challenges around trade uncertainty and the higher cost of doing trade, businesses will adjust their strategies. Some will diversify supply chains, shifting sourcing to economies less impacted by the tariffs, while others may invest in automation and cost take-out exercises to cut costs and reduce dependence on imports.\n\nBeyond the short-term risks, what would the long-term (5- to 10-year) impact of reciprocal tariffs be?\n\nWe anticipate that the US economy will be among the economies most adversely affected by reciprocal tariffs, with the long-term impact on real GDP expected to be negative 0.7% — worth around US$200b annually.",
